THE COMMODORE 64

The Commodore 64, also known as the C64, C-64, C= 64, or occasionally CBM 64 or VIC-64, is an 8-bit home computer introduced in January 1982 by Commodore International. It is listed in the Guinness Book of World Records as the highest-selling single computer model of all time, with independent estimates placing the number sold between 10 and 17 million units.

Volume production started in early 1982, with machines being released on to the market in August at a price of US $595 (roughly equivalent to $1,500 in 2014). Preceded by the Commodore VIC-20 and Commodore PET, the C64 takes its name from its 64 kilobytes (65,536 bytes) of RAM, and has technologically superior sound and graphical specifications when compared to some earlier systems such as the Apple II and Atari 800, with multi-colour sprites and a more advanced sound processor.

Specs:

Operating system: Commodore KERNAL/Commodore BASIC 2.0/GEOS (optionally)
CPU: MOS Technology 6510 @ 1.023 MHz (NTSC version) or @ 0.985 MHz (PAL version)
Memory:	64 kB RAM + 20 kB ROM
Graphics: VIC-II (320 × 200, 16 colors, sprites, raster interrupt)
Sound: 	SID 6581 (3× osc, 4× wave, filter, ADSR, ring)
Connectivity: 2× CIA 6526 joystick, Power, ROM cartridge, RF, A/V, IEEE-488 floppy-printer, digital tape, GPIO/RS-232

THE COMMODORE 128

The Commodore 128, also known as the C128, C-128, C= 128, or occasionally CBM 128, is the last 8-bit home computer that was commercially released by Commodore Business Machines (CBM). Introduced in January 1985 at the CES in Las Vegas, it appeared three years after its predecessor, the bestselling Commodore 64.

The C128 is a significantly expanded successor to the C64, with nearly full compatibility. The new machine has 128 kB of RAM in two 64 kB banks, and an 80-column color video output. It has a redesigned case and keyboard. Also included is a Zilog Z80 CPU which allows the C128 to run CP/M, as an alternative to the usual Commodore BASIC environment. The presence of the Z80 and the huge CP/M software library it brings, coupled with the C64's software library, gives the C128 one of the broadest ranges of available software among its competitors.

The primary hardware designer of the C128 was Bil Herd, who had worked on the Plus/4. Other hardware engineers were Dave Haynie and Frank Palaia, while the IC design work was done by Dave DiOrio. The main Commodore system software was developed by Fred Bowen and Terry Ryan, while the CP/M subsystem was developed by Von Ertwine.

Specs:

Operating system 	Commodore BASIC 7.0, Digital Research CP/M 3.0
CPU: MOS 8502 @ 2 MHz, Zilog Z80A @ 4 MHz
Memory: 128 kB
Graphics: VIC-II (320×200, 16 colors, sprites, raster interrupt), MOS 8563 (RGBI 640×200 16 colors, blitter)
Sound: SID 6581/8580 (3× Osc, 4× Wave, Filter, ADSR, Ring)
