A label widget is a widget that displays some text or bitmap but can
not be clicked on or interacted with by the user.  Generally a label
is for informational purposes, such as saying what the current file
name is. 


------------------------------------------------------------------------
Widget MakeLabel(char *txt);

This function creates a label that contains the text in the character
string pointed to by "txt".  The text will simply be displayed, with
no fancy borders or special highlighting.  If the text contains new
line characters, they will be interpreted properly.

If the argument txt is NULL, then no label will be set for the widget.
This is convienent if you plan to put a bitmap on this widget with the
SetWidgetBitmap() function.

This widget is useful for displaying a piece of textual information
like a filename or user name.

If this routine fails, a NULL is returned.
