                       What is Libsx?

Libsx (the Simple X library) is a library that sits on top of and to
the side of the Athena widget set.  Its purpose is to make writing
graphical applications (particularly those that want to draw graphics)
quite simple.  A hello world program is 2 lines of code. A program
that opens a window and draws some graphics is about 5 lines.  The
library doesn't limit programs to a single canned style however, and
supports building sophisticated interfaces with the same ease as a
simple program.

All widgets can be created with a single function call of a few
arguments.  Another function call positions widgets by specifying
logical relationships.  Once this is done, the interface is created
and user specified callbacks are called as appropriate.  Multiple
windows are possible, as are modal windows.

Libsx provides encapsulation of label, button, slider, toggle/radio
button, text, form, scrolled lists, and menu widgets.  It also
provides a separate drawing area widget (for drawing graphics and
getting user input) as well as a clean single-line text entry widget. 
Management of color is also provided.

The library has been tested on SGI, Sun, and DEC boxes.  It will
likely work on any machine that supports X, the Athena widgets, and
ANSI C. 

Numerous demo programs and two simple applications are provided with
the library, as is documentation for all the functions.  Also included
are a complete file requester, color chooser and form fill-out library.
