README for $PROJHOME/rc 
---------------------------------

This directory contains an archive of the site specific environment
set up files for the SMM project.


Contents:

	mw.smmrc		- Midwest's .smmrc file
	
	sd.smmrc		- San Diego's .smmrc file

	ne.smmrc		- Northeast's .smmrc file

	install.sh		- installation script

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Installation:

These files must be copied to $CCHOME at each site.  A symbolic link
should be created to point to the appropriate file for that site.

For example in Northeast (i.e. Westboro):

	.smmrc -> ./ne.smmrc


Thus for all sites each developer's .cshrc file only needs to source 
the .smmrc file as

	source $CCHOME/.smmrc

where $CCHOME is defined by each site in the .cmsrc file.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Site Specific Customization:

The following variables must be set correctly for each site:

	SITE			two letter site abbreviation, currently

					dv	Denver
					ie	Ireland (Dublin)
					mw	Midwest (Mt. Prospect)
					ne	Northeast (Westboro)
					sc	Santa Clara
					sd	San Diego

	PROJHOME		points to location of "cctools", this is
				expected to be a view extended path name
				of a view of "smm_main" branch

	PROJECT_SERVERS		see next section
