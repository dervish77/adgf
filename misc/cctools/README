README for $PROJHOME -- "cctools"
---------------------------------

This directory contains project specific tools, scripts and files 
for accessing SMM source code under ClearCase.


Contents:

	bin/		- ClearCase related scripts

	config.spec/	- project specific config specs for SMM

	lynx.rc		- LynxOS development setup

	man/		- man pages for ClearCase related scripts

	proj.rc		- project specific setup

	rc/		- archive of environment files for each site

	srclist/	- source branch list files for nightly builds


--------------------------------------------------------------------

Notes:

1) This entire directory tree is archived in the SMM ClearCase repository
as /millenniumvobs/smm_root/cctools.

2) The file /net/fridge/tools/sun4/usr/cctools/.smmrc should be sourced 
by every SMM developer.  It will source the file .projrc contained within
this directory.  The file .projrc contains the remaining setup for 
additional environment variables, aliases, and path changes needed by
the SMM development team.

3) The "bin" directory contains a combination of Bourne shell scripts
and Perl scripts which should make a developer's life easier.  Note that
some scripts are intended solely for use by the project's release
engineer.

4) The "config.spec" directory contains config spec templates for the
SMM project.  Most are generated by the "csgen" script.  Obsolete ones
should be deleted.

5) The "srclist" directory contains source branch list files that are 
used by the nightly build process.  There must be a list file for 
each branch that will be built at night, since it contains the email
addresses of those individuals that must be kept informed as to the 
status of nightly builds.  Note that when automated merging of the site
specific feature branches comes online, the list files are also used
to dictate how the merge is performed.
