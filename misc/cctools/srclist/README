File Format:

The source branch list file is used by the "ccnightly.pl" script
when performing automated feature branch merges executed from a 
cron job.  The file has a specific format as shown below.  The source
branches are listed one per line using the keyword "branch" at the
start of each line.  The keyword "email" is used on all remaining
lines to indicate who should receive email notification of both
success and failure messages.
