README for $PROJHOME/bin -- "cctools" 
-------------------------------------

This directory should contain only those scripts related to ClearCase.


Contents:

User scripts:

	smm_ccbuild.sh		- build script for ClearCase

	smm_ci.pl		- check in script for ClearCase

	smm_fm.sh		- merge script for ClearCase


Admin scripts:

	smm_createbranch.sh	- shell script to create new branches

	smm_csgen.pl		- Perl script for generating config specs

	smm_labelview.sh	- label view script

	smm_newcs.sh		- copy new config spec into VOB

	smm_newdir.sh		- create new directory in ClearCase

	smm_newfile.sh		- create new file in ClearCase

	label.sh		- wrapper script for hdm_labelview.sh


Nightly build scripts:

	ccnightly.pl		- Perl script for nightly builds/merges

	smm_crontab.sh		- cron job script for nightly builds

	nite.sh			- nitely build wrapper used in hdm_crontab.sh

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Notes:

1) The nightly build scripts are designed to be executed via a cron job
running on a viewserver.  The nightly builds should be run by the 
user "TBD".  The file "smm_crontab.sh" should contain one invocation
of "nite.sh" for each branch that is to be built.  

2) If additional processing is required after a build (i.e. checking
for files changes, check in comments, etc.), the script "nite.sh" should
be modified to perform those functions.

3) The scripts "csgen" and "newcs" are designed to be used together.  The
script "csgen" simply generates a new config spec template in the current
directory.  The script "newcs" copies the template from $HOME to the correct
place within the SMM root VOB.

When generating new config specs, follow this procedure:

	sv main
	cd $HOME
	csgen <type> [<branch|release> <label|bp|cvsbr>]
	newcs <cs_file_name>
	exit

4) The script "createbranch" will create the branch type in ClearCase
and also the necessary config spec template in the current directory.  It
is assumed that "newcs" will be used to get template into the VOB.

When creating new branches, follow this procedure:

	sv main
	cd $HOME
	createbranch <type> <branch> [<label>]
	newcs <cs_file_name>
	exit

5) The script "newdir" will always create the new directory on the branch
"/main/LATEST".  The directory is not branched to any other branch.

6) The script "newfile" will create the new file as an empty file, then
branch that empty file to both "smm_main" and "smm_main_dev".  It is up 
to the developer who requested the new file to check it out and replace
the contents with something real.
