.SH NAME
mkv - make a view for ClearCase.

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "mkv" \fI<viewname>\fP 

.SH DESCRIPTION
The "mkv" command creates a ClearCase view using the 
specified \fI<viewname>\fP parameter as a portion of the ClearCase 
view tag as follows -- <username>_<project>_<viewname>.  

A config spec with the file name "hdm_<viewname>.cs" is automatically
associated with the new view.  This config spec must exist in one of the
following directories -- $CCHOME/config.spec, $PROJHOME/config.spec, or
$HOME/config.spec.  If no matching config spec is found in the listed 
directories, the command fails and exits.

Once created, the new view is accessed using the "sv" command, and can be
removed using the "rv" command.
