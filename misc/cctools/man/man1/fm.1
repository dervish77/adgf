.SH NAME
fm - branch merge script for ClearCase.

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "fm" \fI<ALL|vob>\fP \fI<src_branch>\fP [\fIprint|merge|grmerge|qualify\fP]

.SH DESCRIPTION
Using the cleartool findmerge command, the script performs a branch to 
branch merge tailored for the SMM project.  
.PP
It assumes that the destination branch is your current view.  Checkout 
comments are suppressed.  The script performs reserved checkouts for 
merged files.

The script will verify that you are in a ClearCase view.  However, the 
source branch is not verified to exist.
