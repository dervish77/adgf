        Utility - elfld
        Author: Jim Petrie
        
        Usage:   elfld <elf_file>
       

This program will open an "elf" format file and display to stdout the 
load information.

This load information is derived from the .elf formatted headers. This 
includes an elf file header describing the file followed by an unlimited 
number of program and section headers.

The program headers are read first to determine the virtual address range 
being loaded. 

The section headers are scanned next to obtain the data which applies to 
each program segment. 

When a valid section has been detected within the range of memory specified 
by the program segment, the data will be loaded. Ooops... since this is a 
display utility, we don't actually load the data but instead we display the 
load information to the screen.

This enables us to look at an elf image as it is loaded into memory. Thus, 
both address and data will be displayed per line.


Caveats: 

This program currently assumes that the elf filename is 
diag24.elf.  This name is hardwired in main.c.
