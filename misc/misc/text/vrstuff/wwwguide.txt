What is the World-Wide Web?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For fifty years, people have dreamt of the concept of a universal database of
knowledge - information that would be accessible to people around the world
and link easily to other pieces of information so that any user could quickly
find the things most important to themselves. It was in the 1960's when this
idea was explored further, giving rise to visions of a "docuverse" that
people could swim through, revolutionizing all aspects of human-information
interaction. Only now has the technology caught up with these dreams, making
it possible to implement them on a global scale.

The World-Wide Web is officially described as a "wide-area hypermedia
information retrieval initiative aiming to give universal access to a large
universe of documents". What the World-Wide Web (WWW, W3) project has done is
provide users on computer networks with a consistent means to access a
variety of media in a simplified fashion. Using a popular software interface
to the Web called Mosaic, the Web project has changed the way people view and
create information - it has created the first true global hypermedia network.

The earliest visions of such systems had as their goal the advancement of
science and education. Although the World-Wide Web project has the potential
to make a significant impact in these areas, it is poised to revolutionize
many elements of society, including commerce, politics, and literature.


What is hypertext and hypermedia?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The operation of the Web relies mainly on hypertext as its means of
interacting with users. Hypertext is basically the same as regular text - it
can be stored, read, searched, or edited - with an important exception:
hypertext contains connections within the text to other documents.

For instance, suppose you were able to somehow select (with a mouse or with
your finger) the word "hypertext" in the sentence before this one. In a
hypertext system, you would then have one or more documents related to
hypertext appear before you - a history of hypertext, for example, or the
Webster's definition of hypertext. These new texts would themselves have
links and connections to other documents - continually selecting text would
take you on a free-associative tour of information. In this way, hypertext
links, called hyperlinks, can create a complex virtual web of connections.

  [image] Figure 1. How hypertext works.

Hypermedia is hypertext with a difference - hypermedia documents contain
links not only to other pieces of text, but also to other forms of media -
sounds, images, and movies. Images themselves can be selected to link to
sounds or documents. Hypermedia simply combines hypertext and multimedia.
Here are some simple examples of hypermedia:

     * You are reading a text on the Hawaiian language.
       You select a Hawaiian phrase, then hear the phrase as
       spoken in the native tongue.
       
     * You are a law student studying the California Revised
       Statutes. By selecting a passage, you find precedents
       from a 1920 Supreme Court ruling stored at Cornell.
       Cross-referenced hyperlinks allow you to view any one of
       520 related cases with audio annotations.

     * Looking at a company's floor plan, you are able to select
       an office by touching a room. The employee's name and picture
       appears with a list of their current projects.

     * You are a scientist doing work on the cooling of steel
       springs. By selecting text in a research paper, you are
       able to view a computer-generated movie of a cooling spring.
       By selecting a button you are able to receive a program which
       will perform thermodynamic calculations.
       
     * A student reading a digital version of an art magazine can
       select a work to print or display in full. Rotating movies of
       sculptures can be viewed. By interactively controlling the movie,
       the student can zoom in to see more detail.
       
The Web, although still in its infancy, has already enabled many of these
examples. It facilitates the easy exchange of hypermedia through networked
environments from anything as small as two Macintoshes connected together to
something as large as the global Internet.


What is the Internet?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Internet is the catch-all word used to describe the massive world-wide
network of computers. The word "internet" literally means "network of
networks". In itself, the Internet is comprised of thousands of smaller
regional networks scattered throughout the globe. On any given day it
connects roughly 20 million users in over 50 countries. The World-Wide Web is
mostly used on the Internet; they do not mean the same thing. The Web refers
to a body of information - an abstract space of knowledge, while the Internet
refers to the physical side of the global network, a giant mass of cables and
computers.

  [image] Figure 2. The countries in black have Internet
                    connectivity. The number of people with Internet
                    access in these countries varies widely, however.
                    Countries in white may have access to email, local
                    isolated networks, or no connectivity at all.
                    Statistics available by FTP from ftp.cs.wisc.edu.

Nobody "owns" the Internet - although there are companies that help manage
different parts of the networks that tie everything together, there is no
single governing body that controls what happens on the Internet. The
networks within different countries are funded and managed locally according
to local policies.

Having access to the Internet usually means that one has access to a number
of basic services: electronic mail, interactive conferences, access to
information resources, network news, and the ability to transfer files.

The World-Wide Web uses the Internet to transmit hypermedia documents between
computer users internationally. Much in the same way, nobody "owns" the
World-Wide Web. People are responsible for the documents they author and make
available publicly on the Web. Via the Internet, hundreds of thousands of
people around the world are making information available from their homes,
schools, and workplaces.

It's possible to use World-Wide Web software without having to use the
Internet. But Internet access is necessary in order to make full use of and
participate in the World-Wide Web. To get more information on the Internet,
how to obtain Internet access, and how to use the Internet, see the section
"How can I get more information?"


How was the Web created?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The World-Wide Web began in March 1989, when Tim Berners-Lee of the European
Particle Physics Laboratory (known as CERN, a collective of European
high-energy physics researchers) proposed the project to be used as a means
of transporting research and ideas effectively throughout the organization.
Effective communications was a goal of CERN's for many years, as its members
were located in a number of countries.

The initial project proposal outlined a simple system of using networked
hypertext to transmit documents and communicate among members in the
high-energy physics community. There was no intention of adding sound or
video, and the capability to transmit images was not considered.

By the end of 1990, the first piece of Web software was introduced on a NeXT
machine. It had the capability to view and transmit hypertext documents to
other people on the Internet, and came with the capability to edit hypertext
documents on the screen. Demonstrations were given to CERN committees and
seminars, and a demonstration was given at the Hypertext '91 conference.

Throughout 1992 Tim continued to speak on and evangelize the project, as
small handfuls of developers began to volunteer their time into working on
small pieces of the World-Wide Web puzzle.

Since then hundreds of people throughout the world have contributed their
time writing Web software and documents or telling others about the Web. In a
way never envisioned by the original project group, the project has reached
global proportions. In the first four months of 1994 alone, the World-Wide
Web has been mentioned by CNN, the Wall Street Journal, the Economist,
Fortune magazine, the New York Times, and dozens of computer publications.


How popular is the Web?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

From January to December 1993, the amount of network traffic (in bytes)
across the National Science Foundation's (NSF's) North American network
attributed to Web use multiplied by 187 times. In December 1993 the Web was
ranked 11th of all network services in terms of sheer byte traffic - just
twelve months earlier, its rank was 127.

  [image] Figure 3. World-Wide Web growth. Statistics available
                    by FTP from nic.merit.edu.

In June 1993, Matthew Gray at MIT ran a small program which automatically
travels links within the Web network to try to determine just how many sites
there are that offer information over the World-Wide Web. His small
"World-Wide Web Wanderer" found around 100 sites that month and over two
hundred thousand documents. In March 1994 his robot found over 1,200 unique
sites. Even though the robot's programming was improved somewhat, and a
number of factors may have affected the final count, the growth rate of the
Web from the last half of 1993 throughout the first half of 1994 is amazing
and continues to increase.

Brian Pinkerton at the University of Washington has been maintaining a
similar program called the "WebCrawler". Its last run in mid-May 1994 found
over 3,800 unique Web sites.

Given that many sites are private (hidden behind corporate firewalls or not
connected to the public Internet), it can be safely stated that, as of May
1994, there are at least 4,500 hypertext Web servers in use throughout the
world.

Based on Web site statistics, estimates of the number of knowledgeable Web
users in the world has been as large as two million. However, considering the
number of hosts that frequent the most populated areas of the Web, it is safe
to say that there are around 250,000 to 500,000 current active Web users
today.


A Case Study - Honolulu Community College
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Honolulu Community College officially announced the opening of their
hypermedia site - the first Web site in Hawaii and the first hypermedia
campus-wide information system on the Web - at the end of May 1993. A campus
dinosaur exhibit, interactive map, movies, and publications were offered
there and immediately attracted an international audience.

By September of that year (after 105 days of service), they had received over
23,000 requests for documents and over 112,000 requests for graphics and
other media from nearly 5,000 separate hosts on the network. Today, the site
receives about 7,000 requests per day on average, a large majority of which
comes from outside Hawaii.

Since the site's opening, HCC has received virtual visitors from Xerox,
Digital Equipment Corporation, Apple Computer, Cray, IBM, MIT's Media Lab,
NEC, Sony, Fujitsu, Intel, Rockwell, Boeing, Honeywell, and AT&T (which has
been one of the most frequent visitors), among hundreds of other corporate
sites on the Internet.

Collegiate visitors have originated from campuses such as Stanford, Harvard,
Carnegie-Mellon, Cornell, MIT, Michigan State, Rutgers, Purdue, Rice, Georgia
Tech, Columbia, University of Texas, and Washington University, as well as
other campuses in the United Kingdom, Germany, and Denmark, to name but a
few.

Governmental visitors have come from various departments in NASA, including
their Jet Propulsion Laboratories, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories,
the National Institute of Health, the Superconducting Supercollider project,
and the USDA, as well as government sites in Singapore and Australia. A few
dozen Army and Navy sites throughout the world also visited the site.

Because HCC's service began operation when there were relatively few such
sites in the world, and in part due to its popularity, their growth in
traffic has closely reflected the growth of the Web.


The Popularity of Other Web Sites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Global Network Navigator is an electronic magazine published by O'Reilly
and Associates over the World-Wide Web. It offers news, a calendar of
Internet events, and a virtual marketplace in which companies can advertise
their services. It has roughly 12,000 registered subscribers and receives
about 150,000 to 200,000 requests for documents and media per week from
people all over the Internet.

Perhaps the best example of the growth in Web usage can be seen at the
National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA). The NCSA produces a
number of popular software products for World-Wide Web use and their Web site
is used as documentation for their products as well as a repository for
announcements of new events on the Web. In July 1993 NCSA's site received
roughly 100,000 requests per week. Currently it receives at least one million
requests per week and its traffic continues to increase.


Who Travels the Web?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

An informal comparison of host statistics from 15 government, research,
educational, and corporate Web sites in March 1994 shows that the people
roaming the World-Wide Web follow the makeup of the Internet fairly well.

Shown are the top five Web users by domain and the average percentage of
total hosts each Web site received. Next to these statistics is the estimated
percentage of total hosts on the Internet for these domains.

Table 1: Top Five World-Wide Web Users, by Domain
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Domain                   Percent of Web Traffic   Percent of Internet Hosts*
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
U.S. Educational (.edu)           49%                       27%

U.S. Commercial (.com)            20%                       26%

U.S. Government (.gov)             9%                        6%

United Kingdom (.uk)               7%                        5%

Canada (.ca)                       5%                        4%
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

* From January 1994 Stanford Research Institute (SRI International)
  statistics, available by FTP from nic.merit.edu.
  
In January 1994, James Pitkow (pitkow@cc.gatech.edu) and Mimi Recker at the
Georgia Institute of Technology held the first World-Wide Web user survey.
Out of 1,300 valid responses, the results indicated the following statistics
about the respondents:

     * 56% were between the ages of 21 and 30,

     * 94% were male,

     * 69% were located in North America, and

     * 45% described themselves as professionals and 
       22% as graduate students.

Although it is impossible to know for sure, it can be guessed that 
the largest segment roaming the World-Wide Web consists of 
four-year campus populations within the United States.


Why Is The Web So Popular?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Web offers a very simple-to-use interface to the traditionally
hard-to-master resources on the Internet. It is probably this ease of use as
well as the popularity of many graphical interfaces to the Web that caused
the explosion of Web traffic in 1993.

The potential of using networked hypertext and multimedia has prompted many
users to create and explore countless innovative applications on the
Internet. It is perhaps no surprise that more educational users are on the
Web than would be expected.


What does the Web look like?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The World-Wide Web exists virtually - there is no standard way of viewing it
or navigating around it. However, many software interfaces to the Web have
similar functions and generally work the same way no matter what computer or
type of display is used. In fact, many users navigate around the Web using
text-only interfaces and are able to see all of the textual information a
user with a graphic display would.

Below is a picture of the typical graphical World-Wide Web interface that you
would see on a computer screen. It may be black or white or in color. In this
example the interface - called a Web browser - works in a window and may be a
software program on any computer with a graphic interface, such as a
Macintosh or an IBM-compatible computer with Microsoft Windows.

  [image] Figure 4. A typical Web browser for a graphic
                    user interface.

The browser has a menu bar on top, where the user can quit, get help on using
the program, and change certain display characteristics such as the screen
font size, the background color, etc.

A scroll bar allows the user to scroll the document page up and down. Because
there is no limit to how wide or small a hypermedia document can be, scroll
bars are often needed in case the document is larger than the viewing window.

Although there are many different ways to represent a document on the screen,
it is often called a page. Usually, those responsible for creating a given
collection of interrelated documents also create a special document which is
intended to be viewed first - one that contains introductory information
and/or a master menu of documents within that collection. This type of
document is called a home page and is generally associated with a particular
site, person, or named collection. The example shows the Flower Shop's home
page.

This document has a picture of a flower, text in a bold font ("Welcome to the
Flower Shop!") and hypertext in which a single word is underlined. This word
("link") is a hyperlink (or link) - typically, clicking on it with a mouse
will cause another document to appear on the screen, which may hold more
images and hyperlinks to other places. There is no one way to represent text
that is linked to other things - some browsers underline, others use special
colors, and many give the user a variety of options.

Images such as the flower picture which are part of the document and are
displayed within the page are called inline images.

Often users create their own personal documents with collections of their
favorite links or biographical information and make them publicly available.
Although these pages are also called home pages (they are a virtual "home"
for the user), they may be called "personal pages" or "hyplans" (hypermedia
plans).

At the bottom of the screen is a set of navigation buttons - because a user
might go to many different screens by selecting links in hypertext, there
needs to be some method of retracing one's steps and reviewing the documents
that have been explored. The back button shows the previously viewed
document. The forward button would show the pages in the order the user
previously viewed them.

An open button allows the user to connect to other documents and networked
resources by specifying the address of the document or resource to connect
to. The user might be able to connect to a document stored locally on the
same machine being used or one stored somewhere in another country.
Typically, such a document would be transferred over the Internet in its
entirety.

The print button allows the user to print out the document seen on the
screen. The user may be given the choice of printing the document with images
and formatting as seen on the screen or as a text-only document.

The page lists an email address - webmaster@flowers.com. A convention on the
Web is to name the person in charge of administrating a World-Wide Web site a
"webmaster" - any problems with the hyperlinks, images, documents, or
questions about the site should be mailed to a webmaster address.


What is Mosaic?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Months after CERN's original proposal, the National Center for Supercomputing
Applications (NCSA) began a project to create an interface to the World-Wide
Web. One of NCSA's missions is to aid the scientific research community by
producing widely available, non-commercial software. Another of its goals is
to investigate new research technologies in the hope that commercial
interests will be able to profit from them. In these ways, the Web project
was quite appropriate. The NCSA's Software Design Group began work on a
versatile, multi-platform interface to the World-Wide Web, and called it
Mosaic.

In the first half of 1993, the first version of NCSA's Web browser was made
available to the Internet community. Because earlier beta versions were
distributed, Mosaic had developed a strong following by the time it was
officially released. Because it allowed documents with images to be viewed
and new media formats such as video and sound to be transferred over the
Internet and pointed to by documents, it became the Web browser of choice for
those working on computers with graphics capability. In 1993 NCSA's Mosaic
products won the Internet Multicasting Service's yearly Ima award for the
Most Innovative Application and the InfoWorld Industry Achievement award.

Because of the number of traditional services it could handle, and due to its
easy, point-and-click hypermedia interface, Mosaic soon became the most
popular interface to the Web. Currently versions of Mosaic can run on
UNIX-based machines such as Sun, Silicon Graphics, and DEC workstations as
well as IBM-compatibles running Microsoft Windows and Macintosh computers.

  [image] Figure 5. NCSA's Mosaic for X Windows.


What can Mosaic do?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Mosaic has the following features:

     * A consistent mouse-driven graphical interface.

     * The ability to display hypertext and hypermedia 
       documents.

     * The ability to display electronic text in a variety of 
       fonts.

     * The ability to display text in bold, italic, or 
       strikethrough styles.

     * The ability to display layout elements such as 
       paragraphs, lists, numbered and bulleted lists, and 
       quoted paragraphs.

     * Support for sounds (Macintosh, Sun audio format, 
       and others).

     * Support for movies (MPEG-1 and QuickTime).

     * The ability to display characters as defined in the 
       ISO 8859 set (it can display languages such as 
       French, German, and Spanish).

     * Interactive electronic forms support, with a variety of 
       basic forms elements, such as fields, check boxes, 
       and radio buttons.

     * Support for interactive graphics (in GIF or XBM 
       format) of up to 256 colors within documents.

     * The ability to make basic hypermedia links to and 
       support for the following network services: FTP, 
       gopher, telnet, NNTP, WAIS.

     * The ability to extend its functionality by creating 
       custom scripts (comparable to XCMDs in HyperCard 
       on Macintosh computers).

     * The ability to have other applications control its 
       display remotely.

     * The ability to broadcast its contents to a network of 
       users running multiplatform groupware such as 
       NCSA's Collage.

     * Support for the current standards of HTTP and 
       HTML.

     * The ability to keep a history of travelled hyperlinks.

     * The ability to store and retrieve a list of viewed 
       documents for future use.


What is available on the Web?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Currently the Web offers the following through a hypertext, and in some
cases, hypermedia interface:

     * Anything served through Gopher

     * Anything served through WAIS (Wide-Area 
       Information Servers)

     * Anything served through anonymous FTP sites

     * Full Archie services (a FTP search service)

     * Full Veronica services (a Gopher search service)

     * Full CSO, X.500, and whois services (Internet phone 
       book services) 

     * Full finger services (an Internet user lookup 
       program) 

     * Anything on Usenet 

     * Anything accessible through telnet 

     * Anything in hytelnet (a hypertext interface to telnet) 

     * Anything in techinfo or texinfo (forms of campus-
       wide information services) 

     * Anything in hyper-g (a networked hypertext system 
       in use throughout Europe) 

     * Anything in the form of man pages 

     * HTML-formatted hypertext and hypermedia 
       documents 


How does the Web work?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Web software is designed around a distributed client-server architecture. A
Web client (called a Web browser if it is intended for interactive use) is a
program which can send requests for documents to any Web server. A Web server
is a program that, upon receipt of a request, sends the document requested
(or an error message if appropriate) back to the requesting client. Using a
distributed architecture means that a client program may be running on a
completely separate machine from that of the server, possibly in another room
or even in another country. Because the task of document storage is left to
the server and the task of document presentation is left to the client, each
program can concentrate on those duties and progress independently of each
other.

Because servers usually operate only when documents are requested, they put a
minimal amount of workload on the computers they run on.

Here's an example of how the process works:

1.       Running a Web client, the user selects a hyperlink
     in a piece of hypertext connecting to another document
     - "The History of Computers", for example.
     
2.       The Web client uses the address associated with that
     hyperlink to connect to the Web server at a specified
     network address and asks for the document associated
     with "The History of Computers". 
     
3.       The server responds by sending the text and any other
     media within that text (pictures, sounds, or movies)
     to the client, which the client then renders for
     presentation on the user's screen.

  [image] Figure 6. A typical transaction between Web
                    servers and clients.
     
The World-Wide Web is composed of thousands of these virtual transactions
taking place per hour throughout the world, creating a web of information
flow.

Future Web servers will include encryption and client authentication
abilities - they will be able to send and receive secure data and be more
selective as to which clients receive information. This will allow freer
communications among Web users and will ensure that sensitive data is kept
private. It will be harder to compromise the security of commercial servers
and educational servers which wish to keep information local. Improvements in
security will facilitate the idea of "pay-per-view" hypermedia, a concept
which many commercial interests are pursuing.

The language that Web clients and servers use to communicate with each other
is called the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). All Web clients and servers
must be able to speak HTTP in order to send and receive hypermedia documents.
For this reason, Web servers are often called HTTP servers.

The phrase "World-Wide Web" is often used to refer to the collective network
of servers speaking HTTP as well as the global body of information available
using the protocol.


HTML - The Hypertext Markup Language
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The standard language the Web uses for creating and recognizing hypermedia
documents is the Hypertext Markup Language (HTML). It is loosely related to,
but technically not a subset of, the Standard Generalized Markup Language
(SGML), a method of representing document formatting languages. Languages
such as HTML which follow the SGML format allow document writers to separate
information from document presentation - that is, documents containing the
same information can be presented in a number of different ways. Users have
the option of controlling visual elements such as fonts, font size and
paragraph spacing without changing the original information.

HTML is widely praised for its ease of use. Web documents are typically
written in HTML and are usually named with the suffix ".html". HTML documents
are nothing more than standard 7-bit ASCII files with formatting codes that
contain information about layout (text styles, document titles, paragraphs,
lists) and hyperlinks.

Free conversion software is available for translating documents from many
other formats into HTML. Filters exist that can convert files in RTF (Rich
Text Format), WordPerfect and FrameMaker as well as man pages, mail archives,
and text-only documents.

The current HTML standard supports basic hypermedia document creation and
layout, but is limited in its capability to support many complex layout
techniques found in traditional document publishing. A new version of HTML,
called HTML+, is under development and should be completed by the end of
1994. When completed, HTML+ will be backwards compatible with HTML and will
support interactive forms, defined "hot spots" in images, more versatile
layout and formatting options and styles, and formatted tables.

                    and hyperlinks to be displayed in documents.


About Uniform Resource Locators
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The World-Wide Web uses what are called Uniform Resource Locators (URLs) to
represent hypermedia links and links to network services within HTML
documents. It is possible to represent nearly any file or service on the
Internet with a URL.

The first part of the URL (before the two slashes) specifies the method of
access. The second is typically the address of the computer the data or
service is located. Further parts may specify the names of files, the port to
connect to, or the text to search for in a database. A URL is always a single
unbroken line with no spaces.

Sites that run World-Wide Web servers are typically named with a www at the
beginning of the network address.

Here are some examples of URLs:

     * file://www.hcc.hawaii.edu/sound.au - 
       Retrieves a sound file and plays it.

     * file://www.eit.com/picture.gif - 
       Retrieves a picture and displays it, either in a 
       separate program or within a hypermedia document. 

     * file://www.eff.org/directory/ - Displays a 
       directory's contents. 

     * http://www.hcc.hawaii.edu/directory/
       book.html - Connects to an HTTP server and 
       retrieves an HTML file.

     * ftp://www.xerox.com/pub/file.txt - 
       Opens an FTP connection to www.xerox.com and 
       retrieves a text file.

     * gopher://www.hcc.hawaii.edu - Connects to 
       the Gopher at www.hcc.hawaii.edu.

     * telnet://www.hcc.hawaii.edu:1234 - 
       Telnets to www.hcc.hawaii.edu at port 1234.

     * news:alt.hypertext - Reads the latest Usenet 
       news by connecting to a user-specified news 
       (NNTP) host and returns the articles in the 
       alt.hypertext newsgroup in hypermedia format.

Most Web browsers allow the user to specify a URL and connect to that
document or service. When selecting hypertext in an HTML document, the user
is actually sending a request to open a URL. In this way, hyperlinks can be
made not only to other texts and media, but also to other network services.
Web browsers are not simply Web clients, but are also full-featured FTP,
Gopher, and telnet clients.

HTML+ will include an email URL, so hyperlinks can be made to send email
automatically. For instance, selecting an email address in a piece of
hypertext would open a mail program, ready to send email to that address.

How can I get more information?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Most of this information is available on the Internet. In order to access
resources specified by a URL, you may need to use a Web browser or connect to
a telnet site that provides a public-access browser. Enter the URL as one
unbroken line without spaces or carriage returns.

The best way to get general information on the Web without a browser is to
telnet info.cern.ch or gopher info.cern.ch. Information on how to obtain
software can also be found there.

If you don't know how to use FTP, Gopher, or telnet, there are dozens of good
books available on how to get on and use the Internet. Although there are too
many introductory books to list, here are a few mentioned by the Unofficial
Internet Book List (to receive the list, send email to savetz@rahul.net).
