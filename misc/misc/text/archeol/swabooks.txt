                    Southwestern Archaeology - Reading List

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The titles on the reading list below were sent in by archaeologists and
anthropologists in response to the question: Is there a recent, concise, and
authorative book on Southwestern Archaeology?. If you would like to add any
titles to the list, please send suggestions and brief descriptions to Brian
Kenny.

From: Cynthia Bettison (bettisonc@iron.wnmu.ed)

     No. I don't think that any that are out are that comprehensive.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

From: Wetherbee Bryan Dorshow (webd@unm.edu)

     I would recommend two books:
     The Dynamics of Southwest Prehistory, edited by Cordell and Gummerman;
     1989 Smithsonian press

     Chaco and Hohokam, edited by Crown and Judge; 1991, School of American
     Research

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

From: Al Shalette (AlShal@aol.com)

     A current favorite of mine is Melinda Elliott's (former editor of El
     Palacio) "Great Excavations - Tales of Early Southwestern Archaeology,
     1888-1939." School of American Research/Univ. WA Press (1995). Available
     from Maxwell Museum Store (505) 277-8601 (10:00 am to 4:00 pm).

     Covers Wetherills, Fewkes, and Morris/Lancaster at Mesa Verde; Kidder at
     Pecos Pueblo; Morris at Aztec; Hodge at Hawikuh; Judd at Pueblo Bonito;
     Haury at Snaketown; Brew at Awatovi; and the Rainbow Bridge-Monument
     Valley Expedition.

     Non technical; good reading; covers history of archaeology not archaeology
     per se. Chip Wills is using this book for one of his courses at UNM.

     More generally, I recently organized a symposium series called "Doing
     Archaeology" in which several of the six speakers were challenged to come
     up with a good, current overview of S.W. archaeology. Consensus was there
     is none.

     Others had difficulty identifying a single title which adequately
     addressed specific analytical topics - with one exception.

     Pete McKenna (BIA) & Tom Windes (NPS) recommend: Rice, Prudence M.,
     "Pottery Analysis: A Sourcebook;" Chicago: The Univ. of Chicago Press.
     McKenna comments: "An encyclopedic sourcebook for archaeological ceramic
     questions, issues, and methods since Shepard. A must for any archaeologist
     with pottery to deal with; the outline of subjects presented by Rice is
     nonpareil for today's archaeological ceramicist."

     Woodbury's History of the Pecos Conference

     Dynamics of Southwestern Prehistory (1989). Linda S. Cordell and George J.
     Gumerman (Smithsonian Institution Press)

     The Organization and Evolution of Prehistoric Southwestern Society (1992).
     Edited by George J. Gumerman (University of New Mexico Press)

     Hohokam and Patayan: Prehistory of Southwestern Arizona (1982). Randall
     McGuire and Michael Schiffer (Academic Press)

     Though not a recent work, nor even a summation of current thinking, the
     Smithsonian Handbook of North American Indians,[ Volume 9 (1979) & Volume
     10 (1983) (both focused on the Southwest) ], provides an excellent window
     into the cultures of the Southwest and the practice of archaeology. In
     addition, Volume 4 , History of Indian and White Relations, is worth
     examining in detail. These volumes elucidate the many political and social
     preconditions subsumed by current practicioners 'students of prehistory.'

     Additional classics include:
     An Introduction to the Study of Southwestern Archaeology (1924). Alfred
     Vincent Kidder (Yale University Press)

     A History of American Archaeology, Second Edition (1980) Gordon R. Willey
     and Jeremy A Sabloff (W.H. Freeman and Co.)

     Ancient Native Americans (1978). Jesse D. Jennings (W. H. Freeman and Co.)

     Snapshots of the Past
     by Prof. Brian Fagan, University of California at Santa Barbara

     Snapshots informs the reader, in the framework of 30 brief essays, about
     the leading issues in archaeology today. Fagan collects many articles from
     his regular "Timelines' column in Archaeology magazine, as well as several
     new articles, into a single volume and leads the reader on a tour through
     time and space, ranging from the ascent of the human species to public
     Controversies that concern today's archaeologist. The "snapshots" are of
     issues of greatest contempomty interest: the Eve hypothesis, the peopling
     of the New World, site looting, the impact of feminism on archaeology, the
     archaeology of slavery, and the spectacular cave art finds at Chauvet
     Grotto in France, among many others.

     Snapshots of the Past
