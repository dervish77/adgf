Indian Ruins of the Southwest

This is a catalog of information about ancient Indian ruins in the Southwest
States (Colorado, Utah, Arizona, New Mexico). The listings include some small
amount of description of the ruins themselves, as well as information on how to
visit them (including how to get more information).

There were actually several different (though related) groups of ancient
Indians that left pueblo and cliff dwelling ruins in the Four Corners area on
into southern Arizona and New Mexico. The most well known of these are the
Anasazi, who lived in the Four Corners area for about 2000 years. However, the
Mogollon, Hohokam, Sinagua, and Salado occupied nearby regions of Arizona
during much of the same time. And after they all disappeared, the early Pueblo
peoples (thought to be ancestors of the Anasazi and Hohokam) also built pueblos
and cliff dwellings whose ruins are visable today.

The word "Anasazi" is a Navajo word meaning "ancient ones" and is used to
describe the ancestors of the current Pueblo peoples of the Four Corners
Region. These Anasazi came into the region somewhere around 700 B.C. Their
earliest lodgings were covered pits. By their halcyon days of between A.D. 1000
through 1300, there were constructing sophisticated pueblo and cliff dwellings
throughout the arrid canyon lands of the region. Around 1300, they abandoned
their dwellings and moved away. The reasons are still unknown, although there
is speculation that prolonged drought played a major role. They left thousands
of ruins across the Four Corners area, and many of these have been excavated by
scientists and partially restored.

Most Anasazi ruins take the form of cliff dwellings (stone-constructed
buildings built in cavernous openings along the cliff faces of the many
canyons) or Pueblos (multi-room, sometimes multi-story, free-standing
dwellings). Almost all Anasazi ruins also include kivas, which are circular
semi-underground ceremonial rooms. Some sites also feature Great Kivas (very
large, public ceremonial rooms) and towers.

The Mogollon (pronounced mug'-ee-yone) (and a branch known as the Mimbres)
lived in the upper drainage of the Little Colorado River in northern Arizona on
down through southern Arizona from 500 A.D. through about 1450 A.D. The Hohokam
lived in the Phoenix basin at about the same time. The Sinagua lived in the San
Francisco Peaks area (near Flagstaff) on into the Verde River valley. The
Salado lived in the Tonto Basin and Globe-Miami areas of Arizona. After the
Anasazi and Hohokam moved out of the Four Corners area (around 1300), the early
Pueblo peoples started inhabiting the Rio Grande River valley.

Although there are many similarities in the several cultures, there were many
differences including architectural styles, artistic designs used in pottery,
basketry and pictographs/petroglyphs, farming techniques, etc. It is clear from
many artifacts found that there was a trading network between these peoples and
the early peoples of the Pacific coast and with Meso-Americans.

(I've rated the various sites with star ratings, with * (1 star) meaning "Only
for really interested parties" and ***** (5 stars) meaning "Must see for
everyone". These ratings are based on personal experience and/or readings (and
of course, your interests/ratings may vary depending on several factors). I've
visited several of these, but not all. Ones that I have no personal experience
with are marked [NPE]. Information on various sites comes from brochures, AAA
TourBooks, the InterPARK Messenger (annual visitor's guide to the National
Parks, Monuments, and Historic areas of the region), the Ferguson & Rohn book
mentioned below, and several other miscellaneous sources.)
