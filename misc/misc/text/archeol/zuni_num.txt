branches break because of the heavy snow on the branches.

Onan U'la'ukwamme (February) (No-Snow-In -Trail-Moon) On this month the snow is
melting because the days are getting warmer, and the ground begins to sprout

little sand storm and the month when most of the seeds that are in the ground
begin to sprout.
