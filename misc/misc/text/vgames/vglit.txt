Subject: 3. BRIEF HISTORY

I had been planning on starting a list like this for a few months when
Galen Komatsu posted a message titled "Classics of Western
Literature^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^HGaming!" to rec.games.video.classic on
24 Oct 1994.  He wanted to start such a list himself.  E-mail was
exchanged and Galen graciously allowed me to have the job of
maintaining this list.  At the same time, Gregg Woodcock sent messages
to both Galen & I with his list of a large number of classic video
game books, most of which he owns!  This document started largely as
an outgrowth of Gregg's original list.  Special thanks to Gregg &
Galen and everyone else who has contributed to this list.

------------------------------

Subject: 4. WHAT THIS DOCUMENT IS, ISN'T, AND WILL BE

The purpose of this document is manyfold.  If you wish to start a
collection of classic video game literature, but don't know what there
is, here's all the information you could want (hopefully).  If you
wish to port your favorite classic to another platform, find the
book(s) that cover it and use them for reference.  If you just found
that much-desired cartridge for your classic home system, but seem to
be having problems playing it, seek out a book here that covers it.
If you think you have a complete run of a classic video game magazine,
but aren't quite sure, check here.  [Note:  At the moment, magazine
information is sketchy.  Please help me complete it.]

Due to the fact that classic video games are from a bygone age, most of
the books & periodicals in this list are out of print.  If one happens
to be in print or back issues of it are available, that information
will be noted in all caps.

This list does not include periodicals that only featured occasional
articles on classic video games.  Such a list would be nearly
impossible to compile and incredibly long.  This list also does not
include books and periodicals related to Nintendo, Sega, etc.  Despite
much debate, I do not consider the NES or SMS to be classic systems.
I also feel this document is long enough as it is, and including them
would make it at least twice as long.  Finally, this list does not
include literature related solely to classic computer systems and
games.  That, too, would only double the length of this document.   I
have made an exception or two for books that cover several games that
were ported to classic systems (e.g. Summer Games by Epyx).

This list is rather U.S.-centric at the moment.  If there is
sufficient demand AND information, Canadian, British, and Australian
information will be added.  (I would prefer to limit this list to
English language publications.)

With version 2.0, I will start adding information on the appearance of
the cover and spines of books.  This information will be designed to
help people find certain books at used book stores.  If you have any
ideas for the format of this information, please e-mail me.

If you have any additions, corrections, or suggestions for this
list, please e-mail lkseitz@iquest.com.  Please allow one week for
responses.  I particularly need notes for most of the literature,
including some that already has notes.  I don't own most of these
books and magazines, and don't claim to have read from cover to cover
all the ones I do have.  (One of the frustrating things about buying
classic video game literature is you want to go play the games after
you read it.  There is currently nowhere I can go to play most classic
arcade games.)  I would also like to hear from you if you make this
list available at an ftp or WWW site.

Subject: 6. FORMAT OF ENTRIES

Book entries are in alphabetical order by author.  The format is as
follows:
        Author; _Title_; ISBN; Publisher; Date; Cover Price (in $US);
Pages; Format (see abbreviations).
Arcade:  List of games covered.
Home:  List of systems covered (see abbreviations) (note 1).
Notes:  Notes from people who have read it, indicated by user name
(see thanks at end).

(Note 1:  The "Home" section is listed only if no specific games are
covered or the specific games covered are not known.  If they are
known, the entry will read something like:
2600:  KABOOM!, PAC-MAN, PITFALL!.
INTV:  B-17 BOMBER, PITFALL!.)

The names of all games are in ALL CAPS the *first* time they are
referenced in connection to a book.  This keeps users from worrying
about mixed case when searching the document.  This is also true of
home systems that are not referenced often enough to have an
abbreviation.  Home system abbreviations are also in ALL CAPS.

Periodicals are in alphabetical order by title.  The format is as
follows:
        _Title_; ISSN; Publisher; First Issue (date)-Last Issue
(date); Frequency; Cover Price (in $US); Pages; Format (see
abbreviations).
Covers:  ARCADE, HOME, COMPUTER, and/or HANDHELD.
Notes:  Notes from people who have read it, indicated by user name
(see thanks at end).

First and last issue numbers will be listed as they are in the
periodical.  This means either number (e.g. 1-20) or volume and issue
number (e.g. v1n1-v2n8).  If only issue numbers are used, this usually
means that the entire run of the periodical is considered "volume 1."
In such cases, if the periodical were to be cancelled and restarted,
that would usually be considered "volume 2."  Other publishers consider
each year the periodical is published to be a separate volume.

contains a fair amount of video game information also.  Contains
several B&W system and game photos of several systems (INTV, Odyssey,
Coleco, Adam, Aquarius, 800, Apple, C-64, Vic 20, etc.)!  Also
contains some INTV computer system game shots of these unreleased
games:  Number Jumbler, Flinstones:  Keyboard Fun, Game Maker and
Basic Programmer.  Also contains a section on peripherals that covers
joysticks (Spectravideo, Coleco Super Action), printers, monitors,
etc.  (APDF35D)
Has a "turn your game system into a computer" section, which features
a brief discussion of ADAM, Aquarius, INTV and 2600 computer add-ons,
as well as a mention of an INTELLIVISION-III (not the INTV-III) with
battery operated controls and built-in speech synth.  Interesting.

"pong-type") systems, but does include photos and articles on the
original ODYSSEY and Fairchild.  A mention of the "soon to be

has a section on the home version, if it existed at the time.  Those
that didn't have a home version talk about some other "similar" home
game.  Each main game, except Frogger, Missile Command, Ms. Pac-Man,
and Turbo, ends with a short section summarizing bonus, popularity,
location, enemies, approachability, sex appeal, age appeal, control
comfort, skill vs. strategy, clocked or not, special effects, value
for money, pros, and cons.  Has one page for "up-and-coming"
(secondary) games and another page for home systems, including the then
unreleased Atari Video System X, which became known as the Atari 5200.

Notes:  He summarizes much of the history of computers in easy-to-read
vignettes, discusses pros and cons of cutting-edge technology such as
the Commodore 64, the TS-1000 and the line of Apple IIs, and basically
is a great read.  He also writes that the first guy to create Pong was
Willy Higinbotham in 1958, who "developed a method for simulating
tennis" on an analog computer and oscilloscope screen.  He writes
about the Baer and Bushnell stuff too, but hails Higinbotham as "the
grandfather of video games."  I'd recommend the book. (nueb0001)

with pointers to what each part of the screen represents and then has
the following sections in outline format:  controls, scoring, dangers,
observations, and strategies.  The following games also have a game

Combat, Missile Command, Space Invaders, and Warlords.  Also includes
sections on high scores, clubs, exact instructions on how to find the
secret room in Adventure, some arcade games, and manufacturer
addresses.  For the completist, the arcade games are DEFENDER,

Notes:  There are (at least) 5 variations of this book and all can be
distinguished by the appearance of the cover.  The rarest version is
the one that was published by Troll as indicated on the front cover
and the spine (the indica says that it was published by Bantam,
though); the other 4 were published by Bantam.  Two of the Bantam
versions have a yellow triangle in the lower right corner of the front
cover that says, "INCLUDES THE HOTTEST TIPS ON PAC-MAN" (the Troll
version has this, too).  They differ in that one says "SPECIAL BOOK
CLUB EDITION" in small letters to the right of the "HOW TO" portion of
the title and the other does not.  The other two (non-"Pac-Man"
Bantam) variations are identical except for the very top portion of
the spine where the rooster can be either red or yellow.  There are
other minor differences as well but the text content appears to be the
same. (woodcock) Each game is presented with a B&W illustration of the
board (WIZARD OF WOR includes a diagram of every maze) with pointers
to what each part of the screen represents and then has the following
sections in outline format:  controls, scoring, dangers, observations,
and strategies.  This would be a good reference for anyone writing a
computer version of these classics. (lkseitz)

Includes index.  By the editor of and could order from _Videogaming
Illustrated_ (see periodicals).  There also exists a hardback edition.
It is labelled "special book club edition" on the inside flap of the
dust cover.  Games were grouped by type (i.e.  Atari's Surround
includes hints on Intellivision's Snafu and Bally's Checkmate) because
the hints were virtually the same.  Each game types has the following
sections:  object, rating, strategies, cross-references, and video
originals.  Each game also has a simple cartoon/illustration to go
with it.  Also includes chapters on taking care of your video games,
computer games, the future of video gaming, and a glossary. (lkseitz)

Arcade:  PAC-MAN.
Notes:  Cover has a super-title saying "The Official Pac-Man Joke
Book." (woodcock)
Each page is a single, labelled, B&W illustration, such as "Paccoon"
or "Pac-Man solving the Rubik's Cube."  I think _The Pac-Man Riddle &
Joke Book_ by Thaler is slightly more original, if you have to choose
between the two. (lkseitz)
There are two versions of this book:
1) $1.95 in dark yellow print in upper right.
2) Bigger $1.95 in black, towards lower right, below Pac-Man.
Otherwise, they're identical.  BTW, Haller Schwarz is not a person,
but a group of people. [This is true, I had just neglected to mention
it. (lkseitz)] (atariman)

Arcade:  DONKEY KONG.
Notes:  STILL IN PRINT.  [The following notes are excerpts from a post
on rec.games.video.classic.  Things in quotes are chapter names.]  Very
interesting novel about the history of Nintendo.  Went into great
detail about the origin of the company in Japan (creating playing
cards), all the way to about mid '92. "I, Mario" details key creative
people, including Sigeru Miyamoto, the creator of Donkey Kong, which
introduced the Mario character. "For A Fistful of Quarters" explored
Nintendo of America's offering of a table top version of Donkey Kong
in bars.  It goes into Sidney Sheinberg's lawsuit against NOA for the
use of the King Kong character in the Donkey Kong game (the lawsuit
failed). "Reversal of Fortune" goes into the history of Nolan
Bushnell, and Atari's rise and fall. (jaime)

Notes:  It's a history on the toy industry with a great chapter on

also quite a bit about Mattel and Coleco plus some stories about 3rd
party developers.  Later in the book it focuses on the industry circa

Notes:  The author does a psychological case study on himself as he
becomes addicted to Breakout.  Includes Sudnow's visit to Atari HQ to
talk to the programmer, [Somebody?], but he had quit Atari by then so
Sudnow spoke to [Somebody?], programmer of Super Breakout.  Also has
some good tips on playing the 2600 version of Breakout. (lkseitz)

Notes:  To emphasize the importance of Pac-Man on classic video games,
note that each of the above games is a section of a single chapter,
except Pac-Man and Ms.  Pac-Man, which are contained within their own
chapter.  It also covers the Atari 2600 Pac-Man and the Coleco
table-top.  Each games is described with a B&W illustration (not to
scale), a brief description, and sections on the controls, scoring,
and strategy & tactics.  There is also a chapter on home systems,

Notes:  The first chapter compares the home systems of the time:
Atari VCS, Intellivision, ASTROCADE, Odyssey^2, Channel F (CHNF),
ARCADIA-2001, ColecoVision, and Atari 5200.  The second chapter rates
*every* cartridge available for these systems at the time.  This is
done with charts listing the title, number of players possible, and
manufacturer of each game, plus rating from 1 to 5 of "hand-eye
coordination" and "mental challenge."  The third chapter covers "The
20 Best New Games."  Given for each game are "evaluation and basic
objective," "scenario", "the boards," "controls," "facts you should
know," and "strategies."  The fourth chapter covers "The 5 Classic
Games" in the same format as the third. (lkseitz)
        Uston, Ken; _Mastering Pac-Man_; 0-451-11758-1; Signet; 1981;
$1.95; 128p; PB.
Arcade:  MAZEMAN, PAC-MAN, PUC-ONE.
Notes:  All about Pac-Man.  B&W diagrams and seven patterns.  Has one
chapter on Puc-One and Mazeman, which were (illegal?)  Pac-Man
rip-offs, but no patterns for them.  Also has one chapter on the
Coleco table-top version, with patterns. (lkseitz)
A special edition also exists.  The differences are as follows:  No
ISBN; no price; on front cover, below Pac-Man it reads in bold yellow
print "Exclusive Sunset House Edition".  Contents same as original
_Mastering Pac-Man_ - this is not the revised edition. (atariman)
        Uston, Ken; _Mastering Pac-Man_ (revised edition);
0-451-11899-5; Signet; 1982; $2.50; 157p; PB.  Arcade:  PAC-MAN.
Notes:  Ken Uston's Pac-Man book, in an earlier edition, gave a
standard Pac-Man pattern that does not work on the 7th and 8th key
boards on an 'easy' machine, because the red monster is too fast then
and moves far enough ahead to break the pattern.  A later edition
corrected this with what looked like an obviously hastily-added note.
(arromdee)
There are also copies (well, at least one) that say "special edition
revised edition" on the cover.  Shane Shaffer (atariman) says, "my
guess is that this was a book club edition of the book, so they just
slapped a few words on the cover.  (I have lots of non-game books that
say stuff like 'X Book Club Edition'.)  Seems to be more rare - I've
found well over a dozen each of the original and the revised edition,
but only one special edition.  Actually, I found mine by accident."
Shane later found the following additional differences between the two
editions:
1) Revised edition:  Cover, upper right corner reads "Signet blah blah
$2.95".
Special edition:  Same place just says "$2.95".
2) Revised edition:  5 pages of ads for other Signet or Ken Uston
products.
Special edition:  Those 5 pages are blank.

expert scores; controls; the board; characteristics, strategies, and
other versions (if any at the time), which includes arcade sequels
such as SPACE INVADERS PART II and ASTEROIDS DELUXE.  Also has a very
brief section on home systems and table-tops.  This book is full of

Notes:  Marvel tried to get in on the video game fad.  As you can see,
it didn't last long.  Despite the size, this was a magazine and not a
comic book.  It was aimed more at younger readers than adult, but is
still enjoyable.  It also has some good cartoons. (Did you know that
all Donkey Kong wanted was for someone to scratch behind his ears? 8-)

(Oct 1984-Apr 1985); $2.95; varied 82-138p; MAG.
Covers:  ARCADE, HOME, COMPUTER, HANDHELD.
Notes:  The very first video game magazine.  The name was changed to
_Computer Entertainment_ with the May 1985 issue. (wal)
_Electronic Games_ started out by covering "Videogames, Computer
Games, Stand-Alone Games, and Arcades".  This held true for the
majority of the its history, but the focus was almost strictly
computer games during the last several issues.  Coverage of coin-op
arcade games seems to have dropped off about half way into the history
of the magazine. (blair)
It is known that the Mar 1982 issue is vol. 1, no. 2.  _Electronic
Games_ was restarted in Oct 1992.

Covers:  HOME, COMPUTER.
Notes:  Beginning with March 1984 issue, name changes to _ENTER:  The
World of Computers and New Technology_, although some non-computer
home video game coverage continues.  While not as devoted to home
games as other game specific mags of the time, I like this magazine.
Lots of good pictures and interesting/fun articles. (jmcdonald)

year"; $2.95; 64p; MAG.
Covers:  ARCADE, HOME, COMPUTER.
Notes:  V2N3 is also my last issue.  I had a subscription and was
still in the business at that time, so I think it probably folded.

Evidence (above) strongly suggests that v2n3 (Dec 1983) was the last
issue.  Color.  Many screen shots.  By the same publisher who did the
Consumer Guide books.
