A SPECULATIONS subscriber reports: "I rewrote a story at Dawn Brooke's Deadly
Beauties request, and received a contract offering $0.02/word. I wrote back,
telling them that professional rates were $0.03 or greater. I also added a
reversion clause, since they offered payment on publication. Ms. Brookes sent
back a very nice letter, upping the offer to $0.03...since...her rewrite
suggestion was a good one, I have accepted" her offer.

GUIDELINES:

DEADLY BEAUTIES
Erotic SF Anthology

Stories must center on strong female characters who use their charm, wit and
sexual power to achieve their objectives. In futuristic societies and alternate
world senarios these independent femme fatales are lust and destruction in one
intriguing character. Potential characters would include androids
(Rachel:Bladerunner), cyborgs (Running Delilah), cyber-simulacrums (Virtual
Valerie), metamorphs (Species:H.R.Giger), psi-police (Babylon 5), scientists,
spies and time travellers.
Sensual and seductive, she lures her victims (men and/or women) consciously or
involuntarily to their demise. Key to acceptance is the character of the Deadly
Beauty.
Stories must have intriguing plots built on the SF premise, and sensual erotic
thrills involving well defined characters.
Notes on Style: Romantic erotica derives from the development of sexual tension
and arousal through the skillful use of language. Blunt language and
slam-bam-wham action is boring.
The plot and the erotic nature of the characters must tie together.
Please keep horror and supernatural elements to the absolute minimum. Instead,
send emotionally and intellectually satisfying stories written as plausible
events.
Prefered story length is 3,500 to 7,500 words. Deadly Beauties pays TWO CENTS
PER WORD (more for exceptional work at the editors discretion) UPON ANTHOLOGY
PUBLICATION.

Forward standard format manuscripts to:
DEADLY BEAUTIES
P.O. Box 63017

Author Beware:

Unfortunately, this is a busy month:

My first warning involves Crescent Books, which I regrettably listed in my
previous column. According to the latest *Scav* and several writers on Genie
and the Internet, when you submit a novel to Crescent Books, you will quickly
receive a reply telling you to send your MS to book doctors, at your expense,
and only after that will Crescent take another look at your book.

Shortly after hearing from Crescent's editor, all these writers were contacted
by the book doctors, who gave their prices. Remember, writers do not pay
publishers or editors. They pay you.

In every report I've heard -- and I've heard several -- either the Crescent
editor or the book-doctor always misspelled the writer's name and/or got the
story title misspelled or wrong. One writer warns Crescent uses the same book
doctors as Baldwin & Knowlton Books: William Appel and Denise Sterns. You may
recall my warning about Baldwin & Knowlton Books in a previous column. Run
away!

According to numerous reports, two (unrelated) anthologies, Idle Hands
(formerly titled Idol Hands) and Deadly Beauties, have not yet been sold to a
publisher.

If you choose to submit to these or other on-spec anthologies, exercise
caution, and always remember to add a reversion clause to any contract that
doesn't contain one, so you won't lose all rights to your story if the
anthology or magazine never appears. It is no easier to cold-sell an anthology
than a novel.

A writer warns, "I just learned (the hard way) about Tale Spinner [magazine's]
pay-rate policies."

From Editor Joe Glasgow's e-mail: "As a small publisher we occasionally offer
lower rates during periods of cash flow problems. Normally, we offer the
minimum on a first contract. The comments by our readers on the stories in our
magazine influences future contracts."

The writer says, "By this, they mean that they will pay *less* than 1/2 cent
per word for an author's (who is new to their mag) first sale. My story should
have been" higher, according to the GLs.

Given that 99% of small-press magazines can't escape "cash flow problems," I
suggest that writers not sell to markets that aren't upfront about their true
pay rates.

A writer on Genie says "*Black Lily* [magazine] has had financial problems and
is only paying half what their published guidelines say."

A writer says, "I got this letter today from one Donald Kane, offering me this
deal by which I can purchase items from some special catalogs (catalogs which I
have to _buy_, BTW), and when I've ordered enough, I get 'distribution rights'
I can start selling items from these catalogs to my friends and family,
supposedly at a profit to me...he is [apparently] sending stuff to writers via
lists bought from small press 'zines, I don't want to see someone less
world-wise getting burned by it."

WARNING: CRESCENT BOOKS, a new publisher listed in SPECULATIONS #8, is sending
out rejection letters that tell the writer they would be willing to consider
the MS again once the writer "get[s] in touch with Edit Ink, a book doctor,"
which charges "$5.00 a page for line-by-line edit and critique." Lo & behold,
right after the reject arrives, the writer is contacted by the book doctor. In
one case, CRESCENT's reject letter mistitled the writer's novel in a way that
indicated they couldn't have read the MS. Everything about these reports
indicates a "publisher" to avoid. No author should pay for editing. Run away!

TALEBONES magazine has a NEW ADDRESS: Fairwood Press 10531 S.E. 250th Pl. #104
Kent, WA 98031 Issue #3 is at the printer and "should be out within a few
weeks."

The 4/96 FLASHNET reports Freezer Burn magazine is closed form April through
September.

The Gila Queen's Guide to Markets reports "a subscriber had mail to Scorched
Publications returned, stamped - moved, left no address, unable to forward,
return to sender."

GQ also says "the P.O. is returning mail sent ot UNSOMA."

Temporarily Closed: Blood & Midnight horror magazine is closed until January
1997. Dead of Night horror magazine is on hiatus.

Permanently Closed: American Journal of Fantasy (NewHouse) has been folded due
to lack of funding. The 4/96 Flashnet reports: "Romantic Interludes Magazine is
ceasing publication. Whispering Pines Quarterly e-magazine has folded; last
issue published was Spring 1995. Haligonian Letters has folded."

Looks like Fantastic Collectibles is to be avoided! A writer reports receiving
no payment after repeated attempts -- including a returned certified letter.
Apparently there have been other reports to the SFWA Grievence board. Stay
Away!

A writer Reports that Trevor Smith of Halgonian Letters has said he had to put
it in mothballs due to time problems.

On Genie, Dean Wesley Smith announced the CLOSING of Pulphouse -- all
magazines, all publications. Details to follow.

NEW ADDRESS: Terra Incognita has moved. The new address is:
52 Windermere Avenue #3
Landsdowne, PA 19050-1812
(old mail is being forwarded so don't panic)

A writer reports some difficulties with Dark Fiction and its editor John Bradt.
Financial problems have prompted changes in the previously posted guidelines,
most notably cutting the word limit back to 3000. This eliminated the story the
writer had in submission, even after the requested rewrite.
