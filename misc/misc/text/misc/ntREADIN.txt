 Welcome to the

 [NIGHT TERRORS MAGAZINE]
 SUGGESTED READING PAGE

Below is a short list of short stories which have impressed me. It's the type
of work that I want to publish in NIGHT TERRORS. I have chosen from anthologies
because horror writers should have or be able to find one or more of the listed
and therefore be able to see what I like. But if you really want to know what
NIGHT TERRORS is all about, get the order information for issue #1, then order
it.
