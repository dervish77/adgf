UltraNet Communications Inc. is dedicated to providing high quality, 
high speed Internet access at very affordable rates.  UltraNet is based 
in Marlboro, MA and provides service for a large portion of the 508 and 617
area codes within Massachusetts.  We also offer service in Pelham, NH.  More
information on our calling area is provided below.

UltraNet believes that connecting to the Internet should be made as easy as 
possible.  To achieve that goal, UltraNet has created a software kit which
is customized for your PC which will allow it to directly connect to 
the Internet via a modem.  This allows you to use your friendly Windows
interface to browse the Internet, instead of having to learn an 
(unfriendly) Unix command line interface or someone's idea of a menu 
interface.  More information about the kit is provided later in this 
document.

In order to provide very high quality service, UltraNet utilizes state-of-
the-art, high quality, low cost communication and computer systems.  
UltraNet uses redundant 150 MHz Digital Alpha computer systems as servers.
There's no need to worry about slow response times or system failures.  
We have over 20 GB of high speed disk which is used for news, mail, and 
World Wide Web page retention.  All of this is backed up nightly and is 
protected by multiple layers of surge protectors and uninterruptible power
supplies.

UltraNet is connected to the Internet via multiple T1s (1,544,000 bps).
Should any of these backbones go down, your Internet traffic will be
transparently redirected over the remaining connections.

UltraNet uses very high quality US Robotics modems.  Unlike some other
services, there's no additional surcharge for 28,800 bps access.  We
guarantee a user to modem ratio of no more than 10 to 1, which is much
better than the national average.  This ratio should allow you to get a
modem any time you dial in.  Dedicated dial-up lines are available for an
additional startup charge.
  
For customers requiring high bandwidth, Ultranet provides highly-competitive
ISDN, Frame Relay or DDS leased line connections at speeds up to 1.544 Mbps.
Contact us directly for pricing information, as it is location sensitive.

UltraNet is a commercial Web server providing advertising for New England
based businesses.  We have extensive experience designing HyperText pages
for business use.  Let us show you how you can advertise your business on
the Internet for relatively little money.

In order to provide access at virtually any budget or usage rate, we have 
developed the following commercial and consumer rate schedule.  These rates
are effective as of April 17, 1995.

		Cost            Hours           Addt'l
Plan            Month           Included        Hours

Low-End         $5                2             $2.50
Economy         $10               5             $2.00
Value           $20              20             $1.00
Heavy           $30              60             $0.50
Power User      $50             200             $0.25
Unlimited       $100            Unlimited       $0.00

Unlike our competitors, there are NO STARTUP FEES!  

One of the best things about our plan is that the rate is self-adjusting.
As you use more, your rate decreases.  As soon as you spend an amount
equivalent to the next rate plan, your rate drops to that amount for
additional hours.  For example, if you signed up for the $10 plan, and spent
15 hours on line, your first 10 hours would be billed at $2 per hour.  At
that point you would have spent $20, and your next 5 hours would be billed
at $20 rate, which is $1.00 per hour, etc.

Your maximum bill will be $100 no matter what plan you sign up for or how 
much time you use.

We know that there are other Internet providers out there charging less.
Some of them have slapped a couple of PCs together and claim to be an
Internet provider.  Some of these same folks use 56 Kbps circuits to tie
their equipment together.  Well, you get what you pay for.  If cost is
the most important factor, go with them.  If your time and the quality
of the service and support is worth anything, you'll find that UltraNet
offers the best deal around.

You may pay for your usage by having us bill your charge card on a monthly
basis.  We accept Mastercard, Visa, Discover and POs.  Optionally direct 
billing is available on $20+ accounts for an additional $2.00 per month
which offsets our handling expenses.  

Optionally, you can save money by prepaying for 11 months and receiving the
12th month free.
