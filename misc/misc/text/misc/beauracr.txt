BUREAUCRACY HINTS

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Introduction

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Interactive fiction is partly a story for you to read and partly puzzles for
you to solve. If you feel stuck on a puzzle at any point in Bureaucracy, you
can use this hint booklet. It will give you hints so you can still solve the
puzzle on your own, or it will give you the whole answer. Either way, you can
then continue with the story.

Usually the first hint after a question is just a nudge in the right direction,
and the last one is a full answer. You can learn a little just by reading the
questions, but not much. Just to keep you guessing, we put in some extra
questions and hints that have nothing to do with Bureaucracy. Beware!

How do I get my bank statement delivered to my new address?

  2. Sorry, the bank already mailed one to your old address. Try calling your
     old address.

     getting a change-of-address form at your bank.
  4. You can't.

  2. You don't want to go to jail again, do you?
  3. Than stop trying to alter the check and use your brain to outsmart the

How can I deposit a negative check?

  1. Depositing a negative check is like withdrawing a positive amount.

     bill. You have to be able to cover the balance from your account (which
     you can't cover).
  3. Depositing positive money is the same as making a negative withdrawal.
  4. Two wrongs can make a right and two negatives can make a positive.
  5. Try to withdraw the negative check (the same as depositing a positive
     check).
  6. The withdrawal teller can't handle checks, so you'll have to conduct the
     transaction at the deposit window.
  7. To deposit the negative check (for a positive amount to your account) fill
     out a withdrawal slip and hand it to the deposit teller along with the
     negative check.

How do I withdraw cash from the bank?

  1. Withdrawing money is the same as making a negative deposit.

     cards or negative checks.

The Airport

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Where can I find a courtesy phone?

  1. You can never find one when you really need it.

     Omnia Gallia desk, then go north.

How do I find the Air Zalagasa desk?

  1. Follow the signs...
  2. ...but don't believe them.
  3. The only way to get to the Air Zalagasa desk is from the Airport
     Entrances. You'll never find it wandering along the Concourse.
  4. The signs at the Airport Entrances for the airline desks change.
  5. When the sign DOESN'T say Air Zalagasa, go north twice.

How do I get my Air Zalagasa ticket before the flight leaves the gate?

  1. Murphy's Law says you can't.
  2. The fat man always delays you until your flight leaves.
  3. Make sure you get your ticket for Air Zalagasa anyway. Just give the clerk
     your Omnia Gallia ticket to get your new one.

How do I stop my flight from leaving?

  1. ASK THE DESK CLERK ABOUT FLIGHT 42.
  2. Maybe someone CAN go breaking into the traffic control tower.

How do I get to the gate and onto the plane?

  1. Try to GO TO THE GATE.
  2. You didn't take an airport navigation cours; you can't walk.
  3. If you do people a favor, maybe they'll do you a favor.
  4. Notice the crowd that gathers when you climb the pillar.
  5. There's that speaker that plays that awful music up there.
  6. The crowd is hoping you'll do something about the music.
  7. Pull the wires out of the speaker.
  8. That silences that speaker, but the other speakers can still be heared.
  9. CONNECT THE RED WIRE TO THE BLACK WIRE. The short circuit will silence all
     the speakers in the airport.
 10. When you climb down, the crowd will carry you to your gate in appreciation
     for your good deed. Make sure you have your ticket and have stopped the
     flight from leaving the airport.

The Airplane

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What is that tiny metallic noise I hear when I press the buttons?

  1. It's an announcement.
  2. It's coming over ther headphone/receptacle audio system.
  3. You should wear and plug in the headphones (the bulge in the seat pocket)
     and then press the buttons.

Why are the buttons over my seat all mixed up?

  1. Because it's a FubAero Jet. The circuits seem to always be miswired
     (although methodically so).
  2. Maybe you can figure out which button goes to which function and seat.
  3. Light button = Recline the seat 3 rows back (or 6 forward) and 1 seat left
     (or 3 right).

     seats left (or right).
  5. Call button = Lights the seat 1 row forward.

  1. Would you eat someone else's stew?

  3. Unfortunately, you can't sit next to the Zalagasans, so you can't get them
     to eat your stew.

  3. Hum a few bars of the misic you hear over the headphones.
  4. You can't get them to leave their seats. Why would you want to?

How can I get the woman to leave her seat?

  1. She's more concerned about her baby then you.
  2. When you walk past her seat, you disturb her baby, and she leaves her seat
     to calm the baby down.
  3. You need to REALLY upset the baby to get the woman away from her seat long
     enough to sit in it.
  4. Read anything good lately?
  5. Read the airline magazine. Princess Ani-ta'a terrifies babies.
  6. SHOW THE AIRLINE MAGAZINE TO THE BABY.
  7. The mother will now leave her seat long enough for you to sit in it. Big
     deal. Are you proud of yourself scaring babies?

  2. It shows how to survive a plane crash.
  3. I guess the last step is important (and missing).

     hatch window.

How do I stop from falling and dying?

  1. You can't stop gravity, but maybe you can slow it down.
  2. You need to have gotten a parachute beforehand.

     time.)

  3. Read the sign on the locker.
  4. The ones and zeroes represent the handle states. (1=Down, 0=Up)
  5. Turn two handles at a time, moving from one pattern of ups and downs
     (zeroes and ones) to the next. Clicks are good, and if you mess up you'll
     have to reset the locker combination.

     MIDDLE HANDLES. OPEN THE LOCKER DOOR.

  2. Put the cartridge in your computer and play with it.
  3. You have to type PRINTB, PRINTC, PRINTD and PRINTE in the proper order to
     get an intelligible message.
  4. You've seen the letters B through E elsewere on two seperate occasions.
  5. The mail you picked up in the beginning had postal stickers B through E on
     them.

     system of the Complex and mess things up a bit.
  3. After you affect something in the computer system you'll be able to go up
     the shaft.

Who do I log into the computer system as?

  1. Don't you remember who you are? Look up your name in your address book on
     page one.
  2. Try logging in under your old name.
  3. Actually, it's not your name. It's the nerd's: RANDOM Q HACKER. He must

  5. Try RANDOM-Q-HACKER to log in.

What password do I use to log into the computer system?

     about the "modular plug".
  2. Notice what the files do. TYP the various files.
  3. The nerd is RUNning HAK.EXE to execute the various .HAK files. This allows
     him to hack different locations such as the airport.
  4. Notice what the nerd DOESN'T hack.
  5. The nerd never hacks DVH2.HAK. That's because it would crash his computer.
  6. You need to get DVH2.HAK executed to crash the nerd's computer.

The nerd is always running HAK.EXE, so I can't run it. How do I execute the
various [filename].HAK files?

  1. There's more than one way to skin a cat.
  2. Get the nerd to execute DVH2.HAK for you.

     about to execute.
  5. COP and REN are useful commands.
  6. COP DVH2.HAK to the [filename].HAK that the nerd is about to execute.
