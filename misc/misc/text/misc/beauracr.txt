BUREAUCRACY HINTS

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Introduction

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Interactive fiction is partly a story for you to read and partly puzzles for
you to solve. If you feel stuck on a puzzle at any point in Bureaucracy, you
can use this hint booklet. It will give you hints so you can still solve the
puzzle on your own, or it will give you the whole answer. Either way, you can
then continue with the story.

Usually the first hint after a question is just a nudge in the right direction,
and the last one is a full answer. You can learn a little just by reading the
questions, but not much. Just to keep you guessing, we put in some extra
questions and hints that have nothing to do with Bureaucracy. Beware!
