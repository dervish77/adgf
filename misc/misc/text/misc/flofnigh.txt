Backplot

      The Ministry of Peace has been recruiting other high-level B5 staff
     members for its Nightwatch program.
      Vorlons appear as angelic, winged beings of light, whose appearance is
     different to each observer. They can fly. (But see jms speaks)

Unanswered Questions

      Is Keffer mercifully dead, or might he reappear as "worse than dead" -- a
     tool of the Shadows a la Morden?
      What will be the ramifications of Zack's turning the shopkeeper in to the
     Nightwatch?
      How far will the Centauri expansion push?
      Why did Londo see nothing when he looked at Kosh? (see Analysis)
      Who was behind the bombing of Sheridan's tram? Who were the young
     Centauri taking orders from, if anyone?
      What ramifications will there be to Kosh's appearance, since it was such
     a closely kept secret before?
      What will happen to the Narn cruiser?
      What other forces do the Narn have that were not caught by the Centauri?
      Where did the cruiser go?
      Have the Centauri made any arrangements with the Minbari, or are they
     relying on their non-interference in the affairs of other races?
      Will Sheridan's planned apology be enough to satisfy his superiors at
     Earthdome, or is he in danger of losing his position?
      What effect will the open transmission by ISN of Keffers recorder log
     have on the Shadows' plans? Will it force them to show their hand?

Analysis

      Night has indeed fallen. As the Centauri government continues to expand
     by attacking other races like the Drazi and the Pak'Ma'Ra, the Earth
     government has entered into an appeasement pact with them. Meanwhile, the
     inward-turning Earth government is using their "Nightwatch" as a means to
     silence dissent. However, Keffer's last flight has made the presence of
     the Shadows in hyperspace known to all of Earth, relayed to them via ISN.

     It's interesting that Kosh risks revealing himself to save one life - the
     same criterion for saintliness/being the Chosen that the Inquisitor
     established (cf. "Comes the Inquisitor").

      Vir and Lennier are both feeling the pressures of knowing a great deal
     about what is going on but not being involved in the planning and decision
     making stages. That they have found each other to talk to is somewhat
     ironic, since each is working for masters who have taken opposing sides -
     Light and Dark - in the coming battle.

      "We will, at last, know peace in our time." This phrase, given by Lantze
     when he announces the Earth-Centauri non-aggression pact, is very similar
     to a phrase used by Neville Chamberlain after signing an appeasement
     agreement with Hitler in 1938 just prior to the invasion of
     Czechoslovakia, an agreement that failed to stop Hitler's expansionist
     policy. The choice of words is probably intended to highlight the futility
     of such a pact with an aggressive party and a foreshadow of future events.
     There are other parallels with Nazi actions (divided between the actions
     of both signatories), but the motivations of the Earth government are not
     race related nor moving towards the domination/submission of other groups.

      NightWatch openly tries to recruit highly placed individuals, not
     appearing too concerned if they refuse. This suggests that they feel
     confident about circumnavigating these people with a strong sense of
     loyalty at a later date, replacing them with a more easily manipulated
     individual.

      Had Sheridan refused to apologize publicly and been replaced, it would
     have been with Ivanova had she accepted Welles offer to work with the
     NightWatch. Otherwise they would have brought in an easily manipulated
     person to command Babylon 5, as Welles indicated.

      This episode shows the new defense grid (cf. "GROPOS") in action for the
     first time. As promised it is an even match for a heavy battle cruiser.
     The battle doctrine for the B5 universe is one of fighters engage
     fighters, heavy ships engage heavy ships. During this combat sequence we
     see what happens when a heavy ship ignores the fighters and fails (for
     whatever reason) to deploy its own fighters. While not capable of inducing
     complete destruction of a heavy vessel in the short term, the fighters can
     strip a heavy vessel of its offensive/defensive armament since such
     weaponry is small compared to the ship and necessarily exposed in order to
     be effective.

      Lantze is a dreamer and idealist, taking any steps to ensure peace for
     Earth. He is someone who feels that the ends justify the means so long as
     it does not involve Earth. This is a direct expression of the anti-alien
     feelings present at the moment on Earth. That Lantze is not directly
     involved in the NightWatch suggests that, while he understands the aims of
     the NightWatch, his concience is not capable of handling the individual
     betrayals involved. Perhaps the ideal politician.

     Welles, on the other hand, is very much caught up in the management of the
     NightWatch. He has no conscience pangs about the betrayal of individals.
     While he is a co-director of The Ministry of Peace, he probably has more
     real power than Lantze because of what he is managing. He is also gifted
     with the art of manipulating people as shown with both Zack and Sheridan
     (although the latter is more aware of the manipulation and capable of
     defending against it.)

      The Narn cruiser will probably use other races threatened by the Centauri
     for assistance, perhaps acting as a mercenary. Or it may find somewhere
     quiet to lie low until it can be called into the service of homeworld. The
     Minbari cruiser Trigati managed to avoid capture for over ten years (cf.
     "Points of Departure").

      The Shadows did not destroy the recorder marker dropped by Keffer. Either
     they failed to detect it (they aren't omnipotent), or they chose to ignore
     it (they are confident it would make no difference, or were unaware of the
     contents).

      Keffer's recording log has been transmitted by ISN. This is exactly what
     Delenn and Sheridan wanted to avoid. Will it force the Shadows' hand now
     that they have been seen? Or will it push the forces of Light into even
     greater efforts?

      The commentary by ISN at the end of the episode suggests that the events
     on Earth are not being manipulated by the Shadows. Of course this could
     just be a politically expedient newscast.

      Kosh's rescue of Sheridan is like a blessing from the heavens. This will
     no doubt be taken as a sign of Sheridan's worthiness to lead the forces of
     Light, as it has already been taken to indicate that Babylon 5 is blessed.

      When Kosh left his encounter suit only Delenn was present. She has
     already seen Kosh. The other ambassadors only saw a being of light rise up
     and rescue Sheridan. Kosh also landed in an empty part of the Zen garden
     before returning to his encounter suit. The conversation in the Zocalo
     between the Narn and the Drazi suggests they are not aware it is Kosh.
     What would the reaction be if these races were to find out that the
     Vorlons had been interfering (apparently benevolently) in the development
     of their race? Would religions collapse under the revelation that their
     supernatural beings were simply ancient aliens?

      Londo failed to see Kosh when he revealed himself. Does this extend to
     all Centauri, or is it peculiar to Londo? If it is the former then it
     suggests that either the Vorlons have not openly visited the Centauri
     (why?) or that their worship of their deceased Emperors as gods has
     diminished the effect of exposure to Vorlons. If it is the latter then it
     must be because of Londo's association with the Shadows. If this is the
     case then what would be the response of other Centauri on seeing a Vorlon?
     (see jms speaks)

      Carrying the above a step further, are Vorlons invisible to Centauri
     and/or to anyone of a race they haven't dealt with before? That suggests
     the possibility that the Shadows might be the same way, visible to some
     people and not to others.

      Delenn seemed somewhat taken aback by Sheridan's unflattering appraisal
     of the Vorlons' motives; she seems willing to regard them as, if not
     completely good, at least altruistic, and is clearly awed by them. It's
     plausible she has perceived Kosh as a Minbari religious figure from the
     start, which has colored her perceptions of him in exactly the way
     Sheridan describes.

     Might Sheridan's less starry-eyed view of the Vorlons be due in part to
     the training he's been getting from Kosh, the point of which (for a while,
     anyway) was to help Sheridan and Kosh understand each other? Put another
     way, has Sheridan learned to fight the legends he believes Kosh's
     appearance is intended to evoke?

      Why do the Vorlons appear as the particular religious figures they do?
     Each of the figures we saw was an idealized version of the race in
     question. Perhaps this is to make themselves seem less alien, more
     familiar and therefore less threatening. The fact that they feel the need
     to do this suggests that their true appearance may be very alien indeed.

      When Sheridan mentioned to Delenn that everyone saw something different
     in Kosh, Delenn replied that each person saw something "according to his
     or her type." That choice of words can be interpreted in a disturbing way,
     to suggest that the Vorlons have organized other sentients into
     categories.

      Might the Shadows' appearance also be subjective? What do they look like
     to Morden, for instance? It may be that the Shadows feel no need to
     deceive others about their appearance, as it might not advance their goals
     (whatever those goals might be.) Clearly the Shadows prefer not to be
     seen, to work through others, but that might be the result of small
     numbers or caution as much as anything else.

      Kosh's true form is probably smaller than what everyone saw; for one
     thing, his encounter suit is shorter than he appeared to be. When he was
     behind the screen in "Midnight on the Firing Line" he appeared to be much
     smaller as well. But he probably does have a physical form of some kind,
     since he was able to touch Sheridan (if it were just telekinesis,
     presumably he wouldn't have needed to leave his suit.)

      Zack is having second thoughts about the NightWatch. Up until now he has
     been happily accepting their money in return for just wearing the armband
     and giving in few reports. He misunderstood their intentions and now
     realizes that should he try to leave he will be branded in the same way as
     the shopkeeper in the Zocalo. The fear of being taken out of society and
     branded as a traitor is greater than the urge to stand up for what he
     believes to be right. Zack's dissatisfaction with the NightWatch might be
     useful at a later date.

      The signal for the Centauri weapons lock on to Babylon 5 sounded like
     that of a submarine sonar. It represents an active weapons lock (ship
     sending out signals to locate its target) rather than a passive lock (ship
     detecting emmissions from its target.) It brings a tension to the
     situation inherited from the submarine warfare genre of films.

      How compatible is an Earth Alliance career and raising children?
     Ivanova's conversation with Lantze suggests that women do bear children
     while actively continuing with their careers. Another hint from JMS that
     the military at least are an equal oppourtunities employer.

      The celebration of Winter Solstice described by Lantze is a pagan
     festival. The celebration of Christ's birth, though important in Christian
     teaching, was not begun until the 4th century. The time of year was chosen
     to counter the celebration of the Winter Solstice. Presumably the
     reference to the public celebration of the solstice indicate a more open
     tolerance of religion on Earth in the 22nd century, and that there are
     other religious groups that celebrate the same period for different
     reasons.

      It's Keffer's obsession with the shadow ship he saw in hyperspace in "A
     Distant Star" that leads to his demise.

      Kosh has now offered his hand to Babylon 5's commander twice, both times
     with potentially disastrous results.

      The exchange between Lennier and Vir might have been more than mere comic
     relief. Perhaps they were actually passing information back and forth
     using a code of some kind -- Vir now appears strongly motivated to do
     something like that.

      Ivanova's lighting of candles at the end of the episode had a deeper
     meaning than may initially be obvious. In Orthodox Jewish tradition,
     Chanukah celebrates both the victory over the conquerors of Jerusalem and
     the victory of those who wanted to uphold traditional values over those
     who wanted to assimilate with the enemy, an internal struggle which is
     also arguably the main theme of the episode. (See jms speaks, here and in
     "The Long, Twilight Struggle")

Notes

      The character "Corwin" is no doubt named after Norman Corwin, JMS' friend
     and mentor.

      Ivanova's comment about Sheridan being weightless depends on one's point
     of view. In a strict, pedantic sense, everyone on Babylon 5 is close to
     weightless, since weight is defined as the force with which a mass is
     gravitationally attracted to another mass, and B5 achieves the illusion of
     weight by rotation, not by gravity. (Leaving aside, of course, the gravity
     of the planet below the station.)

     Sheridan's movement away from the station's axis is due to three factors.
     First, the tram wasn't exactly at the axis, so it was revolving at some
     speed. Just as a rock flies in a straight line if you swing it on a piece
     of string then let go, Sheridan would have moved toward the ground even if
     he'd just stepped gingerly out the door.

     Of course, he didn't; he leapt. Depending on whether the door was facing
     into or against the station's spin, this might have either accelerated his
     descent or slowed it. The fact that he appeared to not leap very hard
     suggests that the door was facing spinward and he wanted to stay in the
     air as long as possible.

     The final factor is the atmosphere, which rotates in the Garden along with
     the ground and everything else. As Sheridan fell, he would be pushed along
     by air revolving at speeds closer and closer to the speed of the ground;
     this would tend to accelerate his fall, since it would cause him to
     revolve more quickly. So the longer he fell, the faster he would be going.
     That effect would probably be fairly weak for most of the fall, so it
     might not have accelerated him to high enough speed to cause serious harm
     when he hit the ground.

     Unfortunately, his inertia would keep him from achieving ground speed even
     with the push of the wind, so as Ivanova said, he would have hit the
     ground as if he'd fallen out of a car on the freeway, even if his rate of
     descent alone wouldn't have been enough to hurt him seriously.

     In any case, Sheridan is probably quite glad Kosh chose that moment to
     make an appearance.

jms speaks

      Janet [Greek] was not available to us for most of this season due to
     illness (flu turning into pneumonia), but she's better now, and will be
     directing our season-ender, "[The Fall of Night]." We hope to have her do
     five or six next year, and will of course try to get her for our first and
     last as with this year and the last of year one; she's kind of our good
     luck charm.

      On Monday we begin our last week of filming. We're going for an eight-day
     shoot this one time, rather than our usual seven-day shoot, because of the
     extraordinary EFX requirements to pull off the finale. It should be a
     doozy.

      How does the finale compare? Hmmm...depends on what you're looking for.
     "Inquisitor" is primarily a character piece, virtually no EFX, but very
     intense. The story is kind of straightforward, with a few kickers along
     the way. "Twilight" is a heavy story episode, that zips all over the B5
     landscape, between the Narns, the Centauri, and elsewhere (he said
     vaguely). The finale, "The Fall of Night," is actually kind of deceptive;
     it starts out fairly calmly and tightens fairly fast. The story is not as
     back-and-forth or layered as Twilight or Coming, it's really about one
     thing. Visually, it's the most ambitious thing we've done to date, and
     probably the most ambitious EFX stuff done for a TV series *ever*. I don't
     think you'll feel left wanting after the episode is done.

      No, the last ep of this season wasn't per se a cliffhanger, though it
     does tip over a few things, so it flows from 222 to 301 fairly smoothly.

      Yeah, this is the other structure that's kind of a favorite of mine. I
     used it also in "Coming of Shadows." It starts out kind of slow, it lulls
     you into a sense that this is going to be a fairly ordinary story, nothing
     major...allowing me to sneak up behind you in the story and just *whack*
     you real hard when you're not expecting it.

      In a few days we will begin shooting the final episode of season two:
     "The Fall of Night." In terms of action, this is the biggest thing we've
     ever attempted. Where normally our scripts have 50-80 scenes/shots (as
     noted in numerical sluglines), this one has 134; of which 64 are EFX
     shots, some in combinations. To understand the weight of that, there were
     60 EFX shots in the entire two-hour pilot. In addition, this has more and
     more *complex* CGI than the first 13 episodes of our first season put
     TOGETHER. Nothing on quite this scale has ever been attempted in series TV
     before, and the irony is that the major part of this covers only a few
     minutes in the fourth act.

     This stuff is going to involve every one of our EFX divisions,
     compositing, makeup, prosthetics, costuming, practical effects, mattes,
     CGI; the visual EFX meeting was the biggest we've ever had, and everyone's
     both sober and excited. Because there are only two options when you go for
     something this substantial: either you're going to do something truly
     amazing, or you're going to massively fall on your face. For our EFX
     people, this is kinda like boarding the wildest ride at Magic Mountain and
     leaving off your seatbelt on a dare...it's one hell of a ride, but boy is
     it dangerous.

     But as Ron Thornton pointed out: no guts, no glory.

     This is also going to be a Janet Greek-directed episode, who for various
     reasons was only available to do our first episode prior to this, but
     she's kind of our good luck charm, and we wanted someone who's done as
     much for us as she has to come in here and helm this...because it could
     probably break a less experienced (on B5) director.

      Thanks. That last sequence is the single biggest effects sequence done
     for TV, insofar as I know. There are 34 composite shots in a matter of
     just a few minutes. Our guys nearly went blind doing it, but it's cool.
     The whole feel, I think, is quite nice.

      Definite agreement on the shuttle sequence, works nicely.

      A wire harness was used; and the effect you ask about [Kosh] was a mix of
     CGI, live action, and rotoscope.

      I think the Kosh stuff is *very* cool...but I don't want to over-sell it;
     best to see it cold.

      Kosh's wings looked like those of the aliens in "The Abyss."
     There was no deliberate homage, but the individual who helped design that,
     working with me, was Steve Burg, who has worked on Abyss and T2.

      Since "The Fall of Night" has now aired in the UK, and word is getting
     out, herewith a post I left on GEnie about Kosh's now-revealed identity. I
     thought it came out fairly well, so I'm repeating it here.

     *****

     Okay. Here it is. I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna reveal Kosh.

     I'm not kidding. Bail now if you're looking in and don't want to know.

     No backsies.

     I mean it.

     Last chance.

     Okay, this is it.

     "If he leaves his encounter suit, he will be recognized."
     "By who?"
     "Everyone."

     "The First Ones taught the younger races, explored beyond the rim, built
     civilizations...."

     Kosh is what you're pointing at when you say "That's Kosh."

     "Yes, the Vorlons have been to Earth, the Vorlons have been everywhere.
     The Vorlons *are*."

     They *are*.

     "For centuries, the Vorlons have helped the younger races, guiding us, and
     --" "And manipulating us?" "It is, as you say, a matter... of
     perspective."

     They *are*...a matter of perspective.

     Each race who sees them, sees something out of their own past, their own
     legends, religions, faiths. A being of light, if you will, but a Drazi
     sees the Drazi version of that, Droshalla; the Minbari see the Minbari
     version of that, Valeria; humans see a human version of that.

     It is the mirror in which we see our beliefs reflected, but is it the
     progenitor of those beliefs...or an implanted image that overlays that
     vision on top of the true form of the Vorlon? Is it revelation, or is it
     manipulation?

     The Vorlons are a cypher. The Vorlons are a matter of perspective. The
     Vorlons are guides...or users, emissaries or puppeteers, who wish to be
     seen a certain way, so that we will react properly.

     Is this good, or is this bad?

     And the truth is, even though you have seen a Vorlon, have you seen THE
     Vorlon, the one behind the image that dances somewhere between your optic
     nerve and your brain?

     Or to quote a message I left long ago, paraphrased from memory, "The hand
     Sinclair sees is not the hand Sinclair sees, and the hand Sinclair sees is
     not the same hand someone else in the room sees, and is not even the hand
     that that person sees."

     The Vorlons Are.

      Kosh is weak. He allowed himself to be poisoned by a Minbari and attacked
     by Morden. He needed a Vicar to probe Talia and needed Sebastian to test
     Delenn. He rarely does anything directly, preferring to use others. I find
     Kosh slightly righteous.
     Thanks. And finding Kosh slightly righteous is pretty much the desired
     intent. So you're clicking on all the right cylinders.

      Kosh is an angel! But which one?

     Actually, no, not really; Kosh is what you see when you look at him. And
     if a Drazi looks at him, the Drazi sees something different than a
     Minbari; yes, a being of light, BUT....

     Is that what they actually ARE, or how they have programmed us to react
     when we see them? As Sheridan said, have we been *manipulated* to seeing
     them a certain way, seeing a certain image? We may not be seeing what they
     ARE, but what they WANT us to see.

     It goes a heck of a lot deeper than what it seems.

      That's the irony, in a sense...what's inside Kosh's biomechanical
     encounter suit...is a *perceptual* encounter suit....

      Would a Hindu, or a Buddhist, see Kosh differently?
     Yes, there would be some amount of variation among humans, though not in
     terms of beliefs that may have come along post-Vorlon influence. This sort
     of thing has been implanted almost at a genetic level, and they do have a
     hand, or a mind, in activating it when seen. The more people who see them
     in different ways, the longer they must maintain that, the greater the
     strain on them.

      The more people who have to *see* Kosh as one of their own, the greater
     the strain on Kosh, as you'll note in the first ep of year three.

      The Vorlons aren't prepared to fight? They'll refuse?
     As for the Vorlons line..."prepared" should be taken in the same sense as
     "ready"...so they may not yet be ready.

      Yes, the Shadows know that the Vorlons are still around, and that Kosh is
     there. That's never been any kind of secret. They're just hoping that the
     Vorlons and anyone who might believe them won't find out that they're out
     and about again until too [late.]

      The Vorlons aren't yet ready; they can't take on the shadows by
     themselves, and must bring together other forces.

     And in each case, re: Kosh, what they saw was not the *head* of their
     belief, but in essence a supporting being of light; it wasn't G'Quon, but
     G'Lan that G'Kar saw, which was a being that story tells us served G'Quon.
     So you wouldn't see the head of the religion, since there can only be one
     of those, and lots of Vorlons, but each tends to have a supporting cast,
     for lack of a better term. Those are what we perceive the vorlons to be.

     And remember, we didn't see any other human's POV of Kosh but Sheridan's.

      No, she wouldn't. Again, you don't see the *top* of the echelon of any
     belief, because there can be only one of those; it's the servants of light
     you see (and even the Old Testament makes reference to such things).

      When one Vorlon looks at another, he sees a proper Vorlon.

      Will WE see a proper Vorlon?
     We will see them. Eventually.

      What, I should begin catering to prurient interests? Broadcasting picture
     postcards (likely French) of Vorlons in provocative poses, in lingerie? A
     terrible thing, that a nice young man such as yourself should be asking
     about. Does your mother know you're out here doing this? Good heavens.

     And who said they reproduce anymore?

      Where did Kosh go afterwards?
     First he returned to his encounter suit, then he went to his ship, and
     stayed there for quite a while.

      Nnnnnnoo, not really; the Centauri don't actually have an equivalent to
     G'Quan or Valen.

     Believe it or not, this one answer may add another layer to a scene in one
     of the last episodes of this season. You can infer it backwards once you
     see it, but now you'll have it going in.

      They [Centauri] believe in a variety of afterlives; the god you worship,
     of the centauri pantheon, holds dominion over a given "heaven" or
     afterworld. If you appease the god sufficiently during life, it will
     accept you into that afterworld, in preparation for the day when all
     heavens are united; if not, you will have to be reborn and choose another
     until one accepts you.

      Londo saw what he said he saw.

      Basically, all that was indicated in the script was that he for a beat
     isn't sure what's up...then lets it go. I generally don't drop specific
     points explaining foreshadowing in the scripts, in case they leak out. If
     a line like that isn't sufficiently clear for the actor's intent, they
     then come to me and I explain it verbally. This was done in particular
     when we had to shoot "Chrysalis" before "Signs and Portents," even though
     the latter aired before the former.

      "It doesn't matter. This place has been blessed." Nobody was trying to
     claim it was only THEIR deity.
     Thanks. I think that, with so many races around, you couldn't go into holy
     wars or jihads at every occasion. In a way, what was seen was a validation
     for many...a moment they all came together, instead of coming apart.

      Why didn't Clark reprimand Sheridan personally?
     From a strictly logical standpoint, a president would not lower himself to
     deal with this personally. When MacArthur and Patton earned the disfavor
     of the president, it was intermediaries who pulled them aside and
     registered this. Also, gradually more authority is being vested in
     Nightwatch and the Ministry of Peace, as that's his arm, and so he'd be
     inclined to use that since he's in most direct control. (Just to explain
     why what was done was done.)

      There's also a certain amount of McCarthyism inherent in the Nightwatch,
     the emphasis on revealing spies in our midst, enemies of the people.

     The problem with pointing to the Nazis or the Gestapo exclusively is that
     it allows us the safety of saying, "Well, it happened just there, and only
     once, *we* could never fall for that."

     Wrong.

      Bear in mind that Sheridan specifically states that the treaty had *not*
     been finalized yet between Earth and the Centauri, so the attack was not a
     violation of a treaty that hadn't been signed yet. (And very likely the
     Centauri captain was unaware of it *anyway*, just as Sheridan was taken by
     surprise by it all.)

      I hope Sheridan verified those orders.
     And the really great thing is...you're quite right about verifying orders
     from one arm of the government with another...as we'll see in the first
     third of the coming season. Good call.

      The "peace in our time" reference
     Yes, it was a definite nod to Chamberlain, and a bit of foreshadowing for
     ominous things to come.

      There are a number of metaphors in the show that operate on many
     different levels; it can't be a one-to-one corrolary to WW II, because
     that limits and makes predictable your story.

     In musical terms, it's almost a tonal piece, taking elements to which we
     respond, almost subconsciously, and then rearranging them into something
     that is, one hopes, a new construct. You can find here echoes of Vietnam,
     of Kennedy, of Chamberlain, of WW II, of Korea, of the Mideast; in a way,
     it's a thematic piece that touches how we have come to think of war, and
     conflict, across the development of the 20th century, and the role of the
     individual in that regard.

     We have learned to think of war as something now on a huge scale, an
     entity in itself. Once upon a time, before the gatling gun and the
     automatic rifle, combat was something individual, even in larger wars, one
     person against the enemy...and that person was honored, one person could
     turn the tide against the enemy. In a world in which weapons of mass
     destruction exist, where then is the individual? Where then the bravery,
     the struggle, the triumph...and the failure? Where, fundamentally, is the
     responsibility?

     All of that is intertwined with the storyline, and to communicate that I'm
     not averse to taking elements of history that resonate with that theme and
     reworking them, knowing that on a cellular level, we *recognize* that
     aspect, we've seen it...but now in a new context, we can see it
     differently, discuss its implications, *learn* from it.

     This is one of the things I rarely talk about, because it's the kind of
     thing that is best left simply implied, or implicit, in the work, and
     because if you have to draw attention to something in the work, somehow I
     think it lessens it, because it works best unspoken. And because I guess
     it sounds kinda presumptuous, and high-falutin' and self-indulgent. But
     it's one the things that matters to me in the context of the story.

      Symbolism in Ivanova's candle-lighting
     Moshe: an excellent analysis of the theme behind that scene, which as you
     state ties directly into the theme of the whole episode, and moreover,
     somewhat sets up the theme for the coming season...who will determine your
     identity, the rules you follow, who will lead you, and who you are...the
     question of, as you say, those who wish to accommodate and give in to
     pressures from within and from without.

     Didn't want to be heavy-handed about it, so I figured those who got it,
     got it; those who didn't, would see a nice candle scene which sets the
     mood, even if they don't get the full thematic/symbolic aspects that
     others would get.

     (not a Talmudic scholar, but I play one on TeeVee....)

      The narrative [at the end] was a tonal setup for next season.

      Imagery in Season Two episode titles?
     Yes; work it out as you have, but take it further...we start with a point
     of departure...then after some revelations, examine the geometry of
     shadows, then begin to more forward, a race through dark places. We come
     toward the long dark, our past a distant star. We carry the motif of a
     world getting dark. The coming of shadows that darkens into the long
     twilight struggle, the last period between day and night...and we end the
     season on...the fall of night.

      Actually, the "snitch" was the C&C tech, NOT the pilot, they just have a
     somewhat similar appearance.

     We've established that klaxons go off elsewhere in the station during an
     attack to warn civilians, but they aren't going off in C&C because they
     make it impossible to concentrate, as per military tradition (see "And Now
     For a Word" to confirm this).

     There wasn't time to call Draal, and they can't begin relying on him for
     every problem; they have to be able to hold their own. You would only
     bring in Draal on something really major.

      Is Keffer dead?
     He is an Ex-Keffer.

      Does that mean he's dead?
     Dead as the proverbial doorknob.

      Keffer jettisoned his recording as soon as the Shadow ship started
     scanning him. But the ISN broadcast showed the Shadow ship turning and
     firing.
     Yeah, I kinda figured that recorders like this would be outfitted with a
     receiver for the ship's gun camera. This would be vital to locate ships
     that got lost, and track as long as possible what happened after the log
     was ejected, and before the recorder moved out of range.

      Yes, the camera was still mounted on the Starfury, but cameras even today
     are constantly transmitting to other locations; TV cameras don't just
     transmit on a cable to the box they're attached to, they are uplinked to
     other places. Similarly, the recording device continued to receive
     transmission from the Starfury until such time as it either went out of
     range or, in this case, the transmitter was destroyed.

      What was the part of the station that was shot off?
     It's an area for helping secure ships while being offloaded into the
     zero-G cargo bay right behind it.

      What does "time on target" mean?
     It's an actual military term for launching a lot of stuff, so that even
     though it's launched at different times, it all arrives at once.

      The interceptors line refers to the fact that there are so many incoming
     bursts that the interceptors are only knocking down 90% of them at this
     point, meaning that some of them (the incoming bursts) are getting
     through.

      Visually, yeah, I'd have to say TFoN is one of our biggest from year two,
     and I'm quite fond of it; the only reason that it isn't in my top three is
     because while the last half is very intense, it takes a little bit to get
     there; I like 'em intense from the first frame on.

     For the growing use of montage/intercutting...it's really just a process
     of continuing to learn my craft. So I try out and experiment with
     different techniques. While I love dialogue, and lots of it, I'm also
     coming more and more to appreciate moments where you *only* play the
     visuals, and the music, and get out of the way of the Moment.
