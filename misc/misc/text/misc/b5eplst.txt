The Lurker's Guide maintainers don't set the rerun schedule! Please don't
complain about the schedule to us; we have absolutely nothing to do with
scheduling decisions. Neither does JMS; air schedules are decided by Warner
Bros.

Current Episodes

See the Air Times page in the Reference section for a list of stations and for
satellite feed information.

"R" after the production number indicates a rerun; an episode number indicates
a new episode.
