CASTLE OF EYES
[#6000, $7.95] CASTLE OF EYES is a dark fantasy set in a
pseudo-medieval world of magical splendor and riches. The plot concerns the
intrusion of an outsider into a castle that has been cut off from human
congress for millennia, and the upheaval that can be inflicted on society by
someone with overmuch respect for the truth. Morbid and gothic, yet leavened
with a wry humor, Castle Of Eyes has been compared to the work of Michael
Moorcock and Mervyn Peake.
ISBN 1-56882-008-9

THE HASTUR CYCLE
[#6001, $10.955] This trade paperback collects all of the important tales

AZATHOTH CYCLE
[#6006, $10.95] Ruler of the outer Gods,
Azathoth has existed since the beginning of the universe, dwelling

The concept of Azathoth is central to the Cthulhu Mythos and appears
in many of the tales written by Lovecraft and the Lovecraft Circle of
writers. This book collects the most important tales concerning this
all-powerful deity, and arranges them in the order in which they were
written.
     You'll find 16 tales of horror about the mad, gibbering god of chaos
and its minions, written by established mythos writers such as Campbell,
Ramsey, and others, as well as new stories from new talents.</P>
ISBN 1-56882-017-8

ENCYCLOPEDIA CTHULHIANA
[#6007, $10.95] When H.P. Lovecraft first created the Cthulhu Mythos it 
was little more than a collection of obscure terms and unpronounceable 
names. Since that time in the late 1920s and 1930s, with the inclusion of 
other authors and their additions to the body of lore, the depth and detail 
of the Mythos has grown and in 1981 Chaosium first released Call of 
Cthulhu, fostering a renewed interest in the Mythos and bringing more 
authors and their creations. This release is an important guide to the 
Cthulhu Mythos, including every detail inhumanly possible, arranged in

Nephilim Roleplaying Game
"In those times, when men grew and multiplied after Adam had left Eden, the
Nephilim roamed the Earth." GENESIS 6:4
[#3100, $21.95] There is a dark side to our everyday universe, an unwritten
reality which has been hidden for millennia. Maybe you have unwittingly
encountered this reality: already you are familiar with such worlds as magic,
alchemy, and kabbala.
With Nephilim we invite you to look deeper, to see behind the scene, find the
canvas under the paint. Discover a twilight world of old alchemists bent over
their ovens, of kabbalists tracing their pentacles, of magicians deciphering
their books of spells. This is a world concealed behind the false respectability
of wealthy neighborhoods, non-profit associations, flourishing businesses, and
historical monuments. A world where secret societies wage unseen war upon
each other for political control or control of one of the five magic fields. A
world of mystery and occult magic, which originates in the characters that you
play the Nephilim. 144 pages.
ISBN 1-56882-023-2

CHRONICLE OF THE AWAKENINGS
[#3102, $16.95]  Each Nephilim has experienced many lives in the past. 
With each incarnation, a Nephilim draws closer to enlightenment. This 
book adds sixteen new Past Lives to those already found in the Nephilim 
rulesbook, presenting a variety of historical eras during which your character 
might have lived. The new eras are: Mycenae, Greece, 1200 BC; The 
Kingdom of Carthage, 200 BC; Rome, Italy, 1000 AD; Jerusalem, 1120 AD;
Las Nava de Tolosa, Spain, 1212 AD; Avignon, France, 1378 AD; Florence, 
Italy, 1480 AD; London, England, 1590 AD; The Americas, New England, 
1650 AD; London, England, 1730 AD; The Scottish Rebellion, 1745 AD; Paris, 
France, 1789 AD; The Siege of Paris, 1873 AD; The Great War, 1916 AD; and 
Berlin, Germany, 1933 AD.
     Four new metamorphoses are presented: Baen Shide (moon), Fomorian (water), 
Baba Yaga (moon), and Tecarian (earth).
     A new Metamorphoses system introduces custom transformations for each 
Metamorphoses, so that Angels grow wings, Tritons grow gills and can breath 
underwater, etc. Each transformation is linked to a new Passions system, so 
that as a Nephilim acts in accordance with its Passions, its transformations grow 
more pronounced, and more useful. Finally, a host of new Simulacra round out 
the book.
ISBN 1-56881-035-6

NEPHILIM CHARACTER DOSSIERS

NEPHILIM GAMEMASTERS' VEIL
A Gamemaster Screen, Scenario, Celestial Alignment Wheel, &
expanded weapons table.
[#3101, $14.95] A NEPHILIM PLAY AID -- The Nephilim
Gamemasters' Veil provides the players with the tools that help
make playing Nephilim easier.
     The Gamemaster Screen collects the important information used
during play in a convenient format, complete with page references.
     The Celestial Alignment Wheel simplifies what is probably the
most complex portion of the game: determining the appropriate
magical modifier based on the positions of the planets, the month,
and the day of the week. An easy spin of the wheel dials-up the
correct modifier.
     The 13 page scenario presents an introductory tale introducing many of
the essential concepts of the Nephilim roleplaying game.

SECRET  SOCIETIES
[#3013, $16.95] Since the fall of Atlantis, the secret societies have grown, due 
to Nephilim patronage or human ambition. Many of them have learned to hate the 
Nephilim. Worse yet, many of them have learned to fight the Nephilim. These 
invisible empires rise and fall in combat made even more deadly by its secrecy.
     This sourcebook is for the Nephilim gamemaster to use in devising suitable 
antagonists for the players. Nephilim, despite their mystical power, are surprisingly 
easy to thwart given humans with sufficient occult knowledge, resources, and will. 
Many a Nephilim has found itself impossibly at the mercy of a small band of 
humans armed with the proper information.
     Within Secret Societies you can find this information. It details secret organizations, 
their representative members, spells and special techniques, and maps of headquarters 
or other significant places. Here you can find out how to create a Humonculous, 
activate Orichalka, or learn the special Solar-Ka awakening techniques of the 
Mithradites.
ISBN 1-56882-036-4

SERPENT MOON
[#3104, $19.95] Serpent Moon presents the first major Nephilim adventure campaign.
It consists of four adventures which provide months of fast paced action. Set in the USA, the players uncover a Templar plot to permanently weaken and eventually, eliminate, all Nephilim.

IN DECAY
MELNIBONE is an island, an archipelago set amidst the Oldest Ocean. Ruler
of the Young Kingdoms for the past 10,000 years, Melnibone has seen the
might of its once all-powerful dragons wane. Their terrifying flights are no
longer common, and the dragons sleep longer after each foray.
IMRRYR, the Dreaming City, is the capital of Melnibone. It is rich beyond
imagining, but its people are quiescent, slumbering in a stupor of neglect and
decay.
ELRIC IS EMPEROR, 428th in line of direct-descent from the first
Dragon-Lord. Elric is a brooding albino, unlike his ancestors in many ways.
Yet in his hands rests the future. To be counted Elric's friend is to be found,
dead.
STORMBRINGER is Elric's fearsome runesword, intelligent and malicious.
With its own plan for tomorrow, STORMBRINGER is highly magical,
harkening from an ago when chaos held greater sway upon the world.
THE YOUNG KINGDOMS are a handful of upstart nations, once part of the
Bright Empire, who in the past few centuries have dared to defy once-mighty
Melnibone.

    Magic includes rules for demon summoning, a cast spells system, and
invocations and enchantments. Creatures and personalities chapters describe
the multitude of beasts, denizens and human-like inhabitants of the world.
Spot rules highlight important game details. The gamemaster chapter is
recommended reading for new gamemasters. Two scenarios, six

Stormbringer conversion rules and play aids complete this book. All you add

That is not dead which can eternal lie,
and with strange eons even death may die.
                               --Abd al-Azrad

CALL OF CTHULHU is a horror roleplaying game set during the 1920s.
Much of the world remains unexplored; the dark and forbidden realms are
inhabited by hideous monsters, powerful entities, otherworldly horrors, and
their worshipers.
     This game is based upon the writings of Howard Phillips Lovecraft and a few
others. Lovecraft wrote during the 1920s and 1930s, and he became a cult
figure before dying in 1937. Since then his stature has grown, and now he is
generally recognized as the major American horror-story writer of the
twentieth century.
     The Cthulhu Mythos is named after a god-like entity, Cthulhu
(kuh-THOO-loo is the easiest, though not the most exacting way to say it).
Many Great Old Ones, Cthulhu included, are prophesied to wake and to lay
waste to the world `when the stars are right.'

CALL OF CTHULHU
[#2336, $21.95] In Call Of Cthulhu, ordinary people are confronted by the
terrifying beings and forces of the Cthulhu Mythos. Players portray

play (1890s, 1920s, and 1990s), over 200 Mythos creatures and spells,

massacre of General 'Chinese' Gordon and his forces at Khartoum. The
budding decadent movement in the arts, as exemplified by the drawings of
Aubrey Beardsley and the prose of Oscar Wilde. The bloody, brutal work of

PAGAN SHORE
[#2713, $18.95] The Irish call their homeland "Eire," "Banba," or "Fodhla,"
after three goddesses known to early settlers. In Ireland, the Old Gods still
live. The hills they own are as well-known as the raths belonging to human
kings. 
     Ireland's interior plains feature emerald grasses, clumps of heather, hazel
bushes, isolated oaks, and stranded glacial boulders. Few of the Irish plains
are areable. Irish woods contain oak intermingled with birch, alder, and ash. 
Druids wield real power in Ireland. They oversee the rituals and ceremonies to
which all Irish look for their livelihood: the rituals of harvest, ceremonies of
birth and death. They wield power over kings and battles, with the ability to
geas nobility and halt warefare, like sacred referees. 
     They are greatly respected and greatly feared. Without the druids to direct and
administer it, there would be no celtic culture. 
     Pagan Shore describes Ireland as it might have existed in the time of King
Arthur. It includes notes on generating Irish characters, a survey of Irish
customs, and an atlas of Irish kingdoms. Instead of merely serving the
high-king, characters from an Irish clan can struggle to become kigh-king.
