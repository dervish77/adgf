Questions for Tech:
------------------

1) What percentage of tool development work would there be?  

   Would it be more than 50%?  

   Or would more than 50% of the time be spent dealing with vendor issues
   for CAD and software tools?  


2) Would the opportunity to develop tools be across multiple platforms 
   (specifically for Unix and Win95/NT)?


3) Would I have opportunity to apply such technologies as Tcl/Tk, Java, Perl, 
   C++, Visual C++, GUI front-ends to (vendor and custom) tools, and scripting?


4) Is there a desire to provide on-line documentation (via HTML pages) for 
   the various tools used by the organization?  

   Or even HTML pages that would contain user comments/problems/solutions?


5) Would I be involved in the development of standardized software development
   methodologies?  

   Would this process be documented in paper form or via on-line methods?  

   Would there be a similar effort for hardware development?


6) Other than determining what the best solution is for software configuration 
   management, how much time would I be expected to devote to the day to day
   running of the system?  

   Or would that be someone else's responsibility?


7) Are there any Unix system administration responsibilities involved with
   the position?


8) How much opportunity is there for growth into more of a (diagnotics)
   development role?  

   What are the responsibilities of a such a role?
