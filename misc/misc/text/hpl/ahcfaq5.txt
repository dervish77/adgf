     * Q: What board/card games are available based on Lovecraft or the
       Mythos?
       A: Although the "Call of Cthulhu" role-playing game is the primary
       form of Lovecraftian gaming, HPL's influence has crept into other
       forms of games.
          + "Arkham Horror" (Chaosium 1050). Arkham Horror (sometimes
            referred to as the "board game version of Call of Cthulhu")
            is a game for 1 to 8 players who move about the streets and
            buildings of Arkham, Mass., trying to close 'gates' that are
            opening in the space/time continuum. The catch is that
            monsters are pouring through those gates, making the streets
            particularly dangerous. Plus, closing gates requires the
            player to go through the gate (into some dangerous 'outer
            world'), survive for 2 turns, return, and physically and/or
            magically blast the gate closed (sometimes tough).
            Although Arkham Horror was an overnight success, Chaosium has
            chosen to turn its back on this game. It is out of print, and
            Chaosium has no plans to bring it back, even though people
            are asking for it to be reprinted. Chaosium is also flatly
            rejecting any submissions for 'expansions' to Arkham Horror,
            even though (at least) two have been completely developed and
            submitted.
          + "Creatures & Cultists" (Pagan Publishing PAG2000). Includes
            128 cards, 8 play sheets, and is for 3 to 5 players. "Our
            furiously fuggly card game is now available everywhere-fast,
            funny, and full of Cthulhoid delights! From 3-5 players take
            the roles of Cthulhu cultists, bent on world domination. Each
            player sends out their thugs, sorcerers, and monsters to
            obliterate the enemy. Special event cards like Suck The
            Presidents Brain and the notorious Girl Scout Raid add to the
            wacko mix" - Taken from the Pagan Publishing Catalog
          + "Dark Cults" (Dark House Publishing). This is a storytelling
            card game from 1983, written by Kenneth Rahman. The game is
            moody, and light on mechanics. The fantastic black and white
            artwork on the cards is also by Rahman (using the pseudonym
            "Eymoth") and is worth the cost of the game itself. The logo
            for Dark House bears more than a passing resemblance to that
            of Arkham House.
          + "Illuminati" (Steve Jackson). Illuminati is a table top card
            game based around the concept of secretive illuminati groups
            plotting world domination. One of the standard illuminati
            groups are "The Servants of Cthulhu", their objective being
            to destroy 8 'regular' (non-illuminati) groups.
          + "Illuminati: New World Order" (Steve Jackson Games)
          + "Macho Women with Guns" (Blacksburg Tactical Research
            Center). Role-playing table-top board wargame (huh?). Perhaps
            the ultimate spoof game, it includes dread Bthulhu
            (illustrated wearing shorts & shades, & carrying a surfboard
            - horrifying!) and the fearsome Isaac Azathoth as monsters. A
            supplement includes a scenario in which the heroines are
            transported to Ryleh [sic - I think I got that right] and
            must fight their way back to the beach without being turned
            into Monster Chow (TM) or - horror of horrors - chipping
            their nail-polish.
          + "Mythos" (Chaosium). Mythos is Chaosium's venture into the
            collectible card game market. Just as Arkham Horror is
            considered the "board game version of Call of Cthulhu",
            Mythos is the card game version. Cards are distributed in
            60-card starter decks and 13-card booster packs. The starter
            decks are formed from a 200-card starter set of cards, while
            the boosters are formed from a combination of the starter set
            and the booster sets. The three booster sets are titled
            Expeditions of Miskatonic University, Cthulhu Rising, and
            Legends of the Necronomicon. An independent set of cards, The
            Dreamlands, will also be available.
     * Q: What role-playing games are available based on Lovecraft or the
       Mythos or have incorporated specific names/elements of the Mythos
       into the game?
       A: Several role-playing games have Lovecraftian elements
       incorporated into them, but only one, "Call of Cthulhu", centers
       itself in Lovecraft's dark universe. Many of the games and
       supplements below can be had for sale or auction in the
       rec.games.frp.marketplace newsgroup.
          + "Call of Cthulhu" (Chaosium) - Call of Cthulhu is the only
            'role-playing' game devoted to the mythos. There are
            primarily 3 time frames that this game is set in (depending
            on your preference):
            1890's - "Cthulhu by Gaslight" or just "Gaslight"
            1920's - "Call of Cthulhu" (the original game)
            1990's - "Cthulhu Now"
            In addition, there is one other 'setting' which is used (not
            in time, but in place):
            "Dreamlands" - based upon the dreamlands setting created by
            Lovecraft, et al.
            The basic premise of this game is that players act out
            (verbally, in general; some interactive role-playing might be
            used) the parts of "investigators" in a world where cults of
            evil humans, and strange monsters of both indigenous and
            outer-worldly origin are trying to bring about the
            re-emergence of the imprisoned Old Ones (or Great Old Ones).
            The actions of all game elements, besides those of the
            players, are controlled by the "Keeper of Arcane Secrets" (or
            "Keeper"). The ultimate goal of the investigators is to
            discover, and thwart, the evil minions of the Old Ones,
            without dying a horribly mutilating death, or going
            irrevocably insane.
          + 6070 - GURPS ("Generic Universal RolePlaying System")
            CthulhuPunk (Steve Jackson Games) - A supplement called
            'CthulhuPunk' was released in late March of 1995. It is a
            cross between "Call of Cthulhu" and GURPS Cyberpunk, using
            the GURPS system. Chapters include "The Cthulhu Mythos", "The
            CthulhuPunk World", "Characters", "The CthulhuPunk Campaign",
            "Investigators", "Cultists", "Mythos Bestiary", "Adventure
            Seeds", and "Conversions".
          + Advanced Dungeons and Dragons (TSR) - AD&D is not devoted to
            the Cthulhu Mythos, but rather to fantasy/medieval
            adventuring. However, their first printing of a book called
            "Deities and Demigods" contained AD&D game statistics for the
            "Cthulhu Mythos". While the list is pretty inconsistent with
            what Call of Cthulhu players (and Lovecraft readers in
            general) feel, it is still interesting for some DMs to throw
            a "shoggoth" into the forray on occasion, to keep players on
            their toes.
          + "Toon" (Steve Jackson) - The "Tooniversal Tour Guide" (Steve
            Jackson Games, supplement to TOON cartoon role-playing game)
            contains 21 pages on "The Crawl of Catchoolu", the rules for
            an extremely silly Mythos spoof, where one can find such
            horrible tomes as "The Pop-Up Book of Forbidden Knowledge"
            and "The Necronomicomizomicon". Also included are details of
            Mousekatonic University in Darkham, MA; horrible creatures
            such as "Yu-Go, the Fungi from Cleveland", "Deep Clowns",
            "Crisponians" and "The Insanity Loss Results Table" which
            includes such dire consequences as "Become an accountant" or
            even "Take up wargaming".
     * Available for Call of Cthulhu
          + Chaosium:
            g = For Cthulhu by Gaslight
            n = For Cthulhu Now
            d = For (or containing 1 or more adventures set in)
            Dreamlands
            Some of the following aren't really game materials, but are
            included as a possible interest to people who play Call of
            Cthulhu (The 2 Field Guides actually are, IMHO, great game
            materials).
               o Runequest - The Gateway Bestiary (June, 1980). This
                 supplement included "Additional Monsters for Runequest",

     * Q: What computer games are available based on Lovecraft or the
       Mythos?
       A: A few computer text and graphic adventures have been based on
       Lovecraft's works.
          + Alone In the Dark (I-Motion/Interplay) - This is a graphic
            adventure made by a French company that recently made its way
            over here. It says on the box: "A virtural adventure inspired
            by the works of H.P. Lovecraft". Set in the 20s at a haunted
            house in Louisiana (!). Very well done and quite creepy! Its
            sequel, "Alone in the Dark 2", is not based on any
            Lovecraftian elements.
            "I've got them both [Lurking Horror and Alone in the Dark],
            and think they are VERY good at evoking the mood of a
            mythos-based story. I highly recommend them both to any HPL
            fan." - Jeff (jeffo@INTERNIC.NET)
          + Daughter of Serpents (Millennium Interactive Limited) -
            Although the box to this game never mentions Lovecraft, the
            instruction manual states: "Daughter of Serpents was written
            as an original contribution to the Cthulhu Mythos." The game
            is very attractive, although the storyline is a bit forced.
            It was designed by the same team that made "The Hound of
            Shadow", but is far more sophisticated.
          + The Hound of Shadow (Eldritch Games, Ltd.) - Published in
            England, distributed by Electronic Arts. Graphic/text
            adventure set in 1920's. Specifically mentions "the sinister
            world of H.P. Lovecraft".
          + The Lurking Horror (Infocom) - An all-text adventure set in
            the present at a university inspired both by Miskatonic
            University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. It
            is available in "The Lost Treasures of Infocom" collections.
            "I've got them both [Lurking Horror and Alone in the Dark],
            and think they are VERY good at evoking the mood of a
            mythos-based story. I highly recommend them both to any HPL
            fan." - Jeff (jeffo@INTERNIC.NET)
          + Prisoner of Ice (I-Motion/Infogrames) - Like its predecessor,
            "Shadow of the Comet", this graphic adventure game is
            licensed through Chaosium. It takes place in the Antarctic
            and has elements reminiscent of At the Mountains of Madness.
            The game supports SVGA (640x480x256) and has some very
            attractive animations.
          + Quake (id) -- Quake has a number of Lovecraftian influences,
            including such creatures as Shub-Niggurath. Sandy Petersen,
            the creator of the "Call of Cthulhu" role-playing game, is a
            developer at id.
          + Shadow of the Comet (I-Motion/Infogrames) - Licensed through
            Chaosium, this graphic adventure game takes place in the town
            of "Illsmouth", and plays like a CoC adventure. Occasionally,
            there are flaws in the game design (like forcing the player
            to use the keyboard when they've been using the mouse
            throughout the game thus far), but it's still a very
            entertaining game.
     * Q: Are any Call of Cthulhu games available vie the internet (PBEM,
       MOO, MUSH, etc)?
       A: See the "Internet" part of this FAQ.
     * Q: What music do Call of Cthulhu Keepers recommend as background
       music for playing Call of Cthulhu?
       A: See the "Other Media" part of this FAQ.
