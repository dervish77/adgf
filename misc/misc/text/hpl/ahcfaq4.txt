     * Q: What Lovecraftian movies have been made?
       A: The following list shows you movies that fall under any of the
       following categories:
         1. Screenplay based upon an existing Lovecraft (or
            Lovecraft-related) story.
         2. Original Screenplay, using the names/places/tomes/monsters
            found in Lovecraft (et al) fiction.
         3. Original Screenplay, making vague references to Lovecraft (et
            al) or their mythos-related fiction.
       Movies with a "Lovecraftian" tone, but which make no actual
       mention of Lovecraft (et al) nor his fiction/mythos, are not
       included (because their inclusion can be both questionable, and
       the list could grow out of proportion). In addition, there are
       rumors about "Shadow over Innsmouth" and "Mountains of Madness",
       but they are only rumors. Definitive info would be appreciated.
       Note that the following list of films is alphabetical, rather than
       chronological.
          + Army of Darkness (1993)
              Director: Sam Raimi
              Producer: Robert G. Tapert and Bruce Campbell
            Screenplay: Sam and Ivan Raimi
                 Music: Danny Elfman and Joseph LoDuca
                  Time: 85 minutes
                  Cast: Bruce Campbell (Ash), Embeth Davidtz (Sheila),
            Marcus Gilbert (Arthur), Ian Abercrombie (Wiseman), Richard
            Grove (Duke Henry), Michael Earl Reid (Gold Tooth), Timothy
            Patrcik Quill (Blacksmith), Bridget Fonda (Linda), Patricia
            Tallman (Possessed Witch), Theodore Raimi (Cowardly Warrior),
            Ivan Raimi ("Fake Shemp")
               o See comments for Evil Dead 2
               o Roger Ebert: 2/4; Leonard Maltin: 2/4; Internet Movie
                 Database: 8.3/10.
          + Bride of Re-Animator (1990)
            Director: Brian Yuzna
            Producer: Brian Yuzna
             Company: Re-Animator II Productions, Inc.
                Time: 99 minutes
                Cast: Jeffrey Combs (Herbert West), Bruce Abbott (Dan
            Cain), Claude Earl Jones (Lt. Leslie Chapman), Fabiana Udenio
            (Francesca Danelli), David Gale (Doctor Carl Hill), Kathleen
            Kinmont (Gloria, the bride), Mel Stewart (Dr. Graves)
               o Billed as "H.P. Lovecraft's Bride of Re-Animator" even
                 though no such story exists. (Later in credits they say
                 "based upon the story Herbert West: Re-Animator", which
                 rectifies the error)
               o This film (once again) falls under the controversy which
                 seems to surround Lovecraft films. Some say "great" some
                 say "awful". Basically, this flick seems to re-introduce
                 some of the good elements of the original, but is really
                 cheesy in a lot of places. I'd recommend this only to
                 die-hard Re-Animator fans.
               o Leonard Maltin: 2/4; Internet Movie Database: 6.2/10.
          + Cast A Deadly Spell (1991)
            Director: Martin Campbell
            Producer: Gale Anne Hurd
             Company: HBO
                Time: 96 minutes
                Cast: Fred Ward (Detective Harry Philip Lovecraft), David
            Warner (Amos Hackshaw), Julianne Moore (Connie), Clancy Brown
            (Bordon), Alexandra Powers (Olivia Hackshaw), Charles
            Hallahan (Detective Bradbury)
               o The opening header sets the mood: "Los Angeles, 1948...
                 everybody used magic". The flick surrounds a detective
                 named H. Phillip Lovecraft, who is caught up in an
                 investigation concerning magic, the old ones, etc....
                 Basically, the guest monster at the end of the flick
                 makes it all come together nicely!
               o Many consider this to be one of the best Lovecraft films
                 ever made, despite the fact that it isn't based on any
                 Mythos stories nor is very faithful to the concepts of
                 the Mythos, instead merely dropping names.
               o Internet Movie Database: 7.5/10.
          + The Crimson Cult (1968)
            Director: Vernon Sewell
             Company: Tigon Films (UK)
                Cast: Mark Eden (Robert Manning), Virginia Weatherell
            (Eve), Christopher Lee (Morley), Boris Karloff (Professor
            March), Michael Gough (Elder), Barbara Steele (Lavinia)
               o "Ostensibly it was based on Dreams of the Witch House,
                 but Tigon Films of England made the HPL elements almost
                 unrecognizable. Karloff plays an occult expert called in
                 to investigate strange goings-on at an English
                 countryside mansion. It's just not very good." - Rory
                 Millard
               o This was Boris Karloff's final film.
               o The original British titles are "Curse of the Crimson
                 Altar" and "The Crimson Altar".
               o Leonard Maltin: 2/4.
          + Cthulhu Mansion (1990)
              Director: J. P. Simon
              Producer: Jose G. Maesso & J. P. Simon
            Screenplay: Juan Piquer Simon
               Company: Filmagic / Golden Pictures / Republic Pictures
                  ISBN: 1-55526-898-6
                  Time: 92 minutes
                  Cast: Frank Finlay, Marcia Layton, Brad Fisher, Melanie
            Shatner, Luis Fernando Alves, Kaethe Cherney, Paul Birchard,
            Frank Brana, Emil Linder
               o Although the opening credits say "inspired by the work
                 of HP Lovecraft", this film is a cheap rip off of the
                 big guy's name in the title. Essentially this film has
                 no connection to the Mythos at all. The only mention is
                 a book titled "Cthulhu", but that is more of a demonic
                 text than an obscure mythos tome.
               o Here's an example of how far off the mark this movie is,
                 from the back of the box: "Feeding on fear, the satanic,
                 primal forces of Cthulhu, the Devil's footsoldiers, now
                 stalk the hallways in search of vengeance."
               o For those die-hard occultists out there, you'll hate the
                 confusing symbols of Black and White magic (a goat head
                 superimposed over an up-pointing pentagram? with an
                 inverted burning cross over that?)
               o I've had as-of-yet unsubstantiated reports that this
                 film was retitled "Horror Mansion" and "Black Magic
                 Mansion".
               o Internet Movie Database: 3.5/10.
          + The Curse (1987)
            Director: David Keith
            Producer: Ovidio G. Assonitis
             Company: Trans World Entertainment
                Time: 92 minutes
                Cast: Wil Wheaton (Zachary Hayes), Claude Akins (Nathan
            Hayes), Cooper Huckabee (Doctor Alan Forbes), John Schneider
            (John Willis), Amy Wheaton (Alice Hayes), Malcolm Danare
            (Cyrus)
               o Based on Lovecraft's "The Colour Out of Space".
               o Well, I had been watching "Star Trek: The Next
                 Generation" when I first saw this, so hated seeing that
                 little "Crusher" kid in the movie, but after watching it
                 again, I really did like it. Few folks hate this one,
                 though it has been referred to as "a chore to sit
                 through".
               o Also released under the name "The Farm".
               o So far, this film has three sequels, "The Curse II",
                 "The Curse III: Blood Sacrifice", and "The Curse IV". As
                 far as I know, none of them are Lovecraftian.
               o Leonard Maltin: 2.5/4; Internet Movie Database: 4.3/10.
          + Die, Monster, Die! (1965)
            Director: Daniel Haller
             Company: American-International (US) / Hammer Films (UK)
                Cast: Boris Karloff (Nahum Witley), Nick Adams (Stephen
            Reinhart), Freda Jackson (Letitia Witley), Suzan Farmer
            (Susan Witley), Terence de Marney (Merwyn), Patrick Magee
            (Dr. Henderson)
               o Based on Lovecraft's "The Colour Out of Space".
               o Also released as "The House at the End of the World" and
                 in the U.K. as "Monster of Terror".
               o "..brought to screen for the first time the work of H.P.
                 Lovecraft..."
               o The above quote from 'The Ghouls' (see lower in the
                 FAQ)... obviously wrong, as "The Haunted Palace" is
                 first.
               o "Synopsis: The film was based on one of Lovecraft's
                 favorites, "The Colour Out of Space." Unfortunately
                 HPL's carefully constructed tale concerning the loss of
                 humanity, family decay, and other-worldly colors was
                 mostly discarded by rookie director Daniel Haller. In
                 the rewritten plot, Adams rescues his girlfriend from
                 the sinister Karloff and the elder statesman's prone
                 wife, who are succumbing to madness induced by an
                 unearthed meteorite kept in their greenhouse, where the
                 space stone compels outrageous plant growth. The film
                 degenerates into a monster-on-the-loose fiasco, when
                 Karloff rages out of control after receiving an overdose
                 of radiation." - Rory Millard
               o Leonard Maltin: 2/4.
          + The Dunwich Horror (1970)
            Director: Daniel Haller
            Producer: James H. Nicholson & Samuel Z. Arkoff
             Company: American International
                Cast: Sandra Dee, Dean Stockwell (Wilbur), Ed Begley
            (Armitage), Sam Jaffe (Old Whateley), Lloyd Bochner (Dr.
            Cory), Joanne Moore Jordan (Lavinia), Talia Coppola (Cora)
               o A poor adaptation of the original story. Although some
                 of the elements of the movie (mood, music) are highly
                 Lovecraftian, the plot is slow and plodding. One viewing
                 is usually enough; the second time around this becomes a
                 real snoozer.
               o Leonard Maltin: 2.5/4; Internet Movie Database: 5.2/10.
          + The Evil Dead (1983)
            Director: Sam Raimi
                Time: 85 minutes
                Cast: Bruce Campbell (Ashley J. "Ash" Williams), Ellen
            Sandweiss (Cheryl), Betsy Baker (Linda), Hal Delrich
            (Scotty), Sarah York (Shelly)
               o Leonard Maltin: 2.5/4; Internet Movie Database: 8.1/10.
          + Evil Dead II (1987)
            Director: Sam Raimi
             Company: Rosebud Releasing Corp.
                Time: 85 minutes
                Cast: Bruce Campbell (Ash), Sarah Berry (Annie Knowby),
            Dan Hicks (Jake), Kassie Wesley (Bobby Joe), Theodore Raimi
            (Possessed Henrietta), Denise Bixler (Linda), Richard Domeier
            (Ed Getley)
               o Controversy surrounds this movie (as well as it's
                 predecessor Evil Dead, and it's sequel Army of Darkness)
                 as to whether or not it 'belongs' on this list.
               o On one hand I've had people say "take them off the list"
                 without any consideration.
               o Others say Evil Dead 2 and Army of Darkness have the
                 Necronomicon as such a central role in them, that they
                 definitely belong in this list.
               o For now, they stay. Their future status remains in
                 question.
               o Leonard Maltin: 2/4; Internet Movie Database: 8.2/10
          + From Beyond (1986)
              Director: Stuart Gordon
              Producer: Brian Yuzna
               Company: Taryn Productions / Empire Pictures
            Adaptation: Stuart Gordon, Brian Yuzna and Dennis Paoli
            Screenplay: Dennis Paoli
                 Music: Richard Band
                  Time: 85 minutes
                  ISBN: 0-8051-0323-6
                  Cast: Jeffrey Combs (Crawford Tillinghast), Barbara
            Crampton (Dr. Katherine McMichaels), Ted Sorel (Dr. Edward
            Pretorius), Ken Foree (Bubba Brownlee), Carolyn Purdy-Gordon
            (Dr. Bloch), Bunny Summers (Neighbor Lady), Bruce McGuire
            (Jordan Fields)
               o This screenplay, while fairly Lovecraftian in it's tone,
                 bears only mediocre resemblance to the original story
                 (of about 8 pages). Again, controversy rages over
                 whether this film is "good", "Lovecraftian", etc...
               o Leonard Maltin: 2.5/4; Internet Movie Database: 6.9/10
          + The Haunted Palace (1963)
              Director: Roger Corman
              Producer: James H. Nicholson & Samuel Z. Arkoff
               Company: American-International
            Screenplay: Charles Beaumont
                  Cast: Vincent Price (Charles Dexter Ward/Joseph
            Curwen), Debra Paget, Lon Chaney Jr. (Simon Orne), Frank
            Maxwell, Leo Gordon, Elisha Cook Jr., John Dierkes, Milton
            Parsons (Jabez Hutchinson)
               o Based on "The Case of Charles Dexter Ward", not the Poe
                 poem.
               o Quite possibly the first Lovecraft movie made. Anyone
                 know of an earlier one?
               o Originally realeased as "Edgar Allen Poe's Haunted
                 Palace".
               o "I've seen it. It's one of a number of movies Corman and
                 Price made in the 60s, most of them based on Edgar Allen
                 Poe stories; this one, though, kept nothing from Poe's
                 poem of the same title (although some lines from the
                 poem are quoted), and was based on Lovecraft's The Case
                 of Charles Dexter Ward instead. Actually, "based on" is
                 too strong a term; it's recognisably inspired by TCoCDW,
                 but there isn't much similarity in plot (less than there
                 is between, say, Lovecraft's "Herbert West, Re-Animator"
                 and that movie). However, given that it's "inspired by"
                 rather than "based on", it's a pretty good movie on its
                 own merits -- most of the Corman/Price/Poe series were
                 good, and this is one of the better ones." - Ross Smith
               o "Synopsis: Price plays the dual roles of Charles Dexter
                 Ward and Joseph Curwen. In an 18th Century prologue,
                 Curwen and his assistant (Lon Chaney Jr.) are attacked
                 by angry villagers who are tired of having their women
                 abducted and bred with the Great Old Ones. The sorcerer
                 is burned at the stake, although not before uttering the
                 standard curse, which dooms the future generations of
                 Arkham. When Ward and his wife (Debra Paget) come to
                 Arkham 200 years later, Ward is promptly enslaved by his
                 ancestor's pernicious spirit, and before you can say
                 "Yog-Sothoth" he is quoting from the Necronomicon,
                 opening foul pits, and just behaving abominably in
                 general. Though hardly faithful to its true source.
                 Haunted Palace does incorporate many Lovecraftian
                 elements." - Rory Millard
               o Leonard Maltin: 2.5/4, Internet Movie Database: 6.2/10.
          + In the Mouth of Madness (1995)
              Director: John Carpenter
               Company: New Line Cinema
            Screenplay: Michael DeLuca
                 Music: John Carpenter and Jim Lang
                  Time: 95 minutes
                  Cast: Sam Neill (John Trent), Julie Carmen (Linda
            Styles), Jurgen Prochnow (Sutter Cane), David Warner (Dr.
            Wrenn), John Glover (Saperstein), Bernie Casey (Robinson),
            Peter Jason (Paul), Charlton Heston (Jackson Harglow),
            Francis Bay (Mrs. Pickman)
               o Although it contains several nods to Lovecraft, it is
                 not based on any Lovecraft tales nor contains any
                 explicit references to any of his creatures.
                 Nonetheless, the tone is rather Lovecraftian.
               o The film has a Mrs. Pickman character, and at one point
                 (and only one point) mentions the "Old Ones".
               o The titles of Sutter Cane's books include: "In the Mouth
                 of Madness", "The Hobb's End Horror", "The Feeding",
                 "The Breathing Tunnel", "The Thing in the Basement",
                 "The Whisperer of the Dark", and "(?) Out of Time" (the
                 first word is unclear).
               o Noticed in the credits at the end of the film: "Human
                 interaction was monitored by the Inter Planetary
                 Psychiatric Association. The body count was high, the
                 casualties are heavy."

          + The Lurking Fear (1994)
            Director: C. Courtney Joyner
             Company: Full Moon Entertainment
                Time: 76 minutes
                Cast: Jon Finch (Bennett), Blake Bailey (John Martense),
            Ashley Laurence (Cathryn Farrell), Jeffrey Combs (Dr.
            Haggis), Vincent Schiavelli (Knaggs)
               o Based very loosely on Lovecraft's "The Lurking Fear".
               o This film is only marginally better than "Cthulhu
                 Mansion". Even the presence of Jeffrey Combs can't pull
                 this one out of the dumpster.

            Director: Brian Yuzna (wrapper and Part 3), Christophe Gans
            (Part 1), Shusuke Kaneko (Part 2)
            Producer: Samuel Hadida and Brian Yuzna
             Company: August Entertainment
                Cast: David Warner (Dr. Madden), Richard Lynch (Jethro De

            Benedict), Signy Coleman (Sarah), Jeffrey Combs (H.P.
            Lovecraft)
               o This film was originally released overseas and it took
                 several years before it made it to the United States.
                 The producers wanted it to be released in the theatres
                 rather than going direct-to-video. It was finally
                 released in the U.S. in October 1996.
               o The names of the stories, within the movie are: The
                 Drowned, The Cold, and Whispers.
               o The full name of the film, as printed on the box, is
                 H.P. Lovecraft's Necronomicon: Book of the Dead.
               o "Synopsis: Apparently there are three shorts one each
                 from Japan (Shusuke Kaneko), France (Christophe Gans)
                 and Yuzna's from the USA. They are reportedly taken from
                 Lovecraft's "Cool Air" "Rats in the Walls" and "The
                 Whisperer in Darkness"." - Rory Millard

          + Re-Animator (1985)
            Director: Stuart Gordon
            Producer: Brian Yuzna
             Company: Re-animator Productions / Empire Pictures
                Time: 86 minutes
                Cast: Jeffrey Combs (Herbert West), Bruce Abbott (Dan
            Cain), Barbara Crampton (Megan Halsey), David Gale (Dr. Carl
            Hill), Robert Sampson (Dean Halsey), Gerry Black (Mace),
            Carolyn Purdy-Gordon (Dr. Harrod)
               o Based on Lovecraft's "Herbert West--Reanimator".
               o There seems to be some controversy about whether or not
                 this story bears much resemblance to the original.
                 Apparantly, some parts do, while others have been made
                 for the screen version only.
               o There exists 2 video versions of this film. One has been
                 cut significantly to remove the gore/sex scenes. The
                 other is intact.
               o Whether or not you agree with the screenplay's closeness
                 to the original story, there is little doubt that the
                 gruesome end of Herbert West and the head of Dr. Hill
                 both should prevent them from appearing in a sequel,
                 which (unfortunately) they do.
               o Note that the music that opens the film is identical to
                 that which opens Hitchcock's "Psycho" by Bernard
                 Herrmann.

          + The Resurrected (1992)
            Director: Dan O'Bannon
                Time: 108 minutes
                Cast: Chris Sarandon (Charles Dexter Ward/Joseph Curwen),
            John Terry (John March), Jane Sibbett (Claire Ward)
               o Based on Lovecraft's "The Case of Charles Dexter Ward".
               o This made-for-tv film has had above average ratings, not
                 only being a fairly good film, but also being perhaps
                 the most faithful Lovecraft film yet to date, despite
                 being updated to 1990s Massachusetts.
               o Cheesy special effects, but good atmosphere is still
                 maintained.
               o Opening shot, narrator talks of Providence and the
                 Providence River but the actual scene is (if you know
                 the area) Hartford and the Connecticut river.
               o "Synopsis: Although their version is far more true to
                 Lovecraft than the Haunted Palace, the film seems to
                 bear out Brian Yuzna's contention that "very true
                 adaptions can miss the whole damn point." The film
                 suffers from a total lack of atmosphere due to
                 indifferent location shooting. The real problem is the
                 plot itself. Despite being relatively faithful to the
                 events of the novella, the film is utterly banal when
                 stripped of the cosmic menace underlying Lovecraft's
                 tale. Without the Cthulhu Mythos we are left with a
                 simple bogey story about a private eye chasing after a
                 necromancer." - Rory Millard

          + The Shuttered Room (1967)
            Director: David Greene
                Cast: Gig Young (Mike Kelton), Carol Lynley, Oliver Reed
            (Ethan), Flora Robson
               o Based on August Derleth's "The Shuttered Room", with
                 mixings of "The Dunwich Horror".
               o Some suspense.
               o From Leonard Maltin's Book: "Young couple inherit old
                 house in New England, threatened by local toughs and
                 unseen presence. Good cast deserves better material;
                 even revelation is tame. Based on an H.P. Lovecraft
                 story".
               o "Blood Island" is the video version of "The Shuttered
                 Room".
               o Leonard Maltin: 2.5/4; Internet Movie Database: 7.0/10.
          + The Unnamable (1988)
            Director: Jean-Paul Ouelette
                Time: 87 minutes
                Cast: Mark Kinsey Stephenson (Randolph Carter), Charles
            King (Howard Damon), Alexandra Durrell (Tanya Heller)
               o Once again, nobody can agree as to its sticking to the
                 original story, and as to whether or not it is "good" or
                 "Lovecraftian".
               o "The first movie opens well, expanding the premise of
                 the short piece into a toungue in cheek look at modern
                 student life in Arkham. Alas, it quickly degenerates
                 into a "hack\slash\naked bimbo" flick. The ending almost
                 redeems the premise. In essence, the ancient wizard who
                 shut up his mutant offspring (the unnamable of the
                 title) cast a spell to keep it in that's wearing off.
                 But Randolph Carter can save the day. Silly movie, on
                 the whole." - Christopher Wade Skinner
               o "Synopsis: This is one of the weaker HPL adaptions. The
                 director allows Carter to speak in "Lovecraftese"-
                 certainly not an accurate barameter of modern parlance.
                 Thus, the Carter character puts the film at odds with
                 most viewers inside of five minutes. Lovecrafts's
                 original story, basically a discource on literary
                 definitions is ignored in favor of the standard haunted
                 house spook show, laced with periodic gobs of gore and
                 with a monster that is most definately identifiable. To
                 be fair, the creature is quite well done, but it's a far
                 cry from Lovecraft's gelatinous being that was
                 "everywhere at once."" - Rory Millard
               o Internet Movie Database: 5.7/10
          + The Unnamable II: The Statement of Randolph Carter (1993)
            Director: Jean-Paul Ouelette
                Time: 104 minutes
                Cast: Mark Kinsey Stephenson (Randolph Carter), David
            Warner (Chancellor Thayer), John Rhys-Davies (Professor
            Warren), Charles Klausmeyer (Eliot Damon Howard)
               o Rated higher than the first movie by everyone who sent
                 in a review of this film. One reviewer even went so far
                 as to call it the best Lovecraft or Mythos movie made
                 yet. This may be due only to Maria Ford appearing nude
                 throughout the film...
               o "This is a little better than the first one. Taking the
                 second half of its title from another minor Lovecraft
                 story, Part II brings back the creature from the first
                 film, along with Carter (Stephenson again). The cast
                 also includes a slumming David Warner (who receives top
                 billing for a single scene) and John Rys-Davies as
                 Carter's companion Dr. Warren, who uses the spell from
                 the Necronomicon to untangle the beast from its human
                 host" - Rory Millard
               o Internet Movie Database: 7.2/10.
          + Witch Hunt (1994)
            Producer: Gale Anne Hurd
            Director: Paul Schrader
             Company: HBO
               Music: Angelo Badalamenti
                Time: 100 minutes
                Cast: Dennis Hopper (Detective H. Phillip Lovecraft),
            Julian Sands (Finn Macha), Eric Bogosian (Larson Crockett),
            Penelope Ann Miller (Kim Hudson), Debi Mazar (The
            Manicurist), Sheryl Lee Ralph (Hypolita Kropotkin)
               o This follow-up to "Cast a Deadly Spell" stars Dennis
                 Hopper (instead of Fred Ward) in the role of H. Phillip
                 Lovecraft.
               o This film contains no Lovecraftian elements or
                 references at all, and is only mentioned because it is a
                 sequel to "Cast a Deadly Spell".
               o The music for "Witch Hunt" was done by Angelo
                 Badalamenti, of "Twin Peaks" fame.
               o Internet Movie Database: 7.1/10.
     * Q: What television shows (not including made-for-tv movies) have
       had Lovecraft or the Mythos involved?
       A: Several episodes of various television shows have been based on
       Lovecraft tales.
          + A&E Special? - Possibly there was a special on A&E dedicated
            to Lovecraft, in which he was accused of being a Satanist
            (strange, since The Church of Satan wasn't founded 'til the
            1960's...oh, there I go again, bringing up technicalities and
            semantics), who expressed his beliefs in his stories by
            saying such things as that Azathoth (aka "evil") was growing.
            The source of this obscure tidbit is dubious... Can anyone
            back it up that this show ever existed?
          + "Babylon 5"
               o "Deathwalker": Courtroom scene in which the leader of
                 the League of Non-aligned Worlds (an alien woman with
                 some sort of aquatic ridge along her head) escorts a
                 shrouded alien to its seat. A little bit later, you get
                 a really good glimpse of what is hidden within the
                 shroud--an alien with an octopus-like head, complete
                 with face tentacles. This race, the Pak'ma'ra, have
                 since appeared in several other episodes.
               o "Passing Through Gethsemane": This episode has a
                 character known as Brother "Edward"/"Charles Dexter"; a
                 reference to Lovecraft's The Case of Charles Dexter
                 Ward.
          + "Monsters" - One episode was based on the Frank Belknap Long
            story "The Space Eaters".
          + "Night Gallery"
               o "Cool Air"
               o "Pickman's Model": Starring Bradford Dillman (Richard
                 Pickman) and Louise Sorrel.
               o "Professor Peabody's Last Lecture": Written by Jack
                 Laird. Starring Carl Reiner as a college professor
                 lecturing on cults of the world. Includes references to
                 Cthulhu, Hastur, Nyarlathotep, Arkham, Derleth,
                 Lovecraft, the Necronomicon, and Miskatonic University.
               o "Return of the Sorcerer"
          + "The Real Ghostbusters" cartoon - There were 2 episodes which
            had some form of the Mythos involved:
               o Episode: "Collect Call of Cthulhu" - The investigators
                 wore something like squids on their heads. "Cthulhu
                 makes Gozer look like little Mary Sunshine." Dr. Alice
                 Derleth, from Arkham, helps the Ghostbusters out.
                 - From: Eric Cheung: "Basically, what's happened is...
                   1. The Necronomicon (the actual mythical book that's
                      supposed to be full of stuff 'Man was not meant to
                      know') is stolen by a strange tentacled beast. So
                      the Ghostbusters are brought in because of the
                      mystical/magical nature of the crime.
                   2. They meet up with this babe who dabbles in
                      magic/ancient spell casting who also happens to be
                      an expert on old Cthulian legends.
                   3. Ray Stantz goes to old friend who has a wild
                      collection of old pulp magazines and books from the
                      1920's and 1930's... including all the old books
                      and articles by Lovecraft (incidentally, it was
                      theorized that these articles contained enough
                      facts and stuff that some of the stuff was true...
                      including theories on how to defeat Cthulu)
                   4. A cult of Cthulu followers actually bring about
                      summoning the old god from his sleep in the ocean
                      and Cthulu begins his reign of destruction.
                   5. The 'busters manage to lure Cthulu into an
                      amusement park where they do some weird
                      psuedo-science thing with their proton- packs and
                      the ionization of the materials in a steel roller
                      coaster... the result... fried calimari and
                      Cthulu's physical shell is destroyed (for now).
                 I think it was implied that they actually managed to
                 destroy Cthulu with their actions... but I REALLY have
                 trouble believing that such an action is possible by
                 mortal beings."
               o Episode: "Russian About" - Peter: "*Whew* Why on earth
                 would anyone make all these four foot high terraces?"
                 Egon: "They're not terraces, Peter. They're steps..."
                 This episode was written by J. Michael Straczynski, who
                 is the creator of "Babylon 5".
                 - From: (ez041349@JUDY.UCDAVIS.EDU): The story takes the
                 Ghostbusters to Russia for some lecture (during which a
                 scientist claims that the Titanic really crashed because
                 it ran into Elvis). The GBs eventually are called to
                 action when a book (can't remember what it was called,
                 but it was obviously supposed to be the Necronomicon) is
                 stolen. The book is eventually used by a cult (again) to
                 summon one (or several, I can't remember) of the Old
                 Ones. The Old One(s) start emerging from a deep pit, but
                 the GBs set their packs on overload and blow them up.
     * Q: What publications have detailed descriptions of Lovecraft (et
       al) movies (besides the short 1-2 paragraphs in general
       video/movie anthologies)?
       A: Not only are there articles about Lovecraft films in many
       horror-related magazines, but a few books refer to them as well.
          + Books:
               o The Ghouls by Peter Haining. Stein and Day, New York,
                 1971. This is a great collection of 18 of the best
                 horror movies from 1896 to 1970. The Lovecraft entry is
                 for Monster of Terror/Die, Monster, Die. That entry is
                 27 pages long, but is just a re-print of the story "The
                 Colour Out of Space". Still, the 1st page gives lots of
                 details about the movie itself. I'd recommend this book
                 to hardcore horror movie buffs just because of its
                 information about old, old films.
               o Horror by Leonard Wolf. Bills itself as "A Conoisseur's
                 Guide to Literature and Film" in the genre of horror.
