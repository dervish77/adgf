          + E-mail Bots: For those who don't have FTP or WWW access, you
            can have portions of the FAQ e-mailed to you automatically by
            my e-mail bots. This process only requires that you send me
            (dloucks@primenet.com) an e-mail message with a particular
            Subject line. When your incoming message is detected by my
            e-mail bot, it will e-mail the appropriate section of the FAQ
            to you, and discard your message. With that in mind, don't
            bother sending any messages with contents, because I'll never
            get it. Also, since the mailbot handles everything
            automatically, don't hesitate to request all the parts of the
            FAQ. Here's a list of the exact Subject lines and what each
            gets you:

            FAQ: Mini-FAQ Answers to the top questions asked
     * Q: What is Cthulhu?
       A: The best answer to this question is found in Lovecraft's tale
       "The Call of Cthulhu". Cthulhu is a monstrous entity who lies
       "dead but dreaming" in the city of R'lyeh, a place of
       non-Euclidean madness presently (and mercifully) sunken below the
       depths of the Pacific Ocean. Cthulhu appears in various monstrous
       and demonic forms in early myths of the human race. Racial memory
       preserves Him as humanity's most basic nightmare. Cthulhu is the
       high priest of the Great Old Ones, unnatural alien beings who
       ruled the Earth before humanity formed, worshipped as gods by some
       misguided people. It is said that They will return, causing
       worldwide insanity and mindless violence before finally displacing
       humanity forever.
     * Q: How is "Cthulhu" pronounced?
       A: There are basically three different pronunciations that I have
       heard, other pronunciations being slight modifications on these.
       The most commonly heard pronunciation is that suggested by
       Chaosium, makers of the "Call of Cthulhu" roleplaying game. On the
       back of many of their gaming products is printed the phrase, "Can
       you say kuh-THOOL-hoo?".
       Another pronunciation is that used by several Lovecraftian
       scholars. This form is based on Lovecraft's revision tales where
       Cthulhu is often referred to as "Clooloo" or "Clulu".
       Unfortunately, this form does not have a sound representing the
       "th" combination.
       The pronunciation that I prefer is a compromise between these two.
       The "h" sounds are aspirated, thus the "th" is not as in "them" or
       "thin", but two separate sounds. The first four letters of the
       word are run together in something like a sneezing sound,
       "K't'hoo-lhoo".
       According to H.P. Lovecraft:
       "The actual sound - as nearly as human organs could imitate it or
       human letters record it - may be taken as something like
       Khlul'-hloo, with the first syllable pronounced gutturally and
       very thickly."
       "The best approximation one can make is to grunt, bark, or cough
       the imperfectly formed syllables Cluh-Luh with the tip of the
       tongue firmly affixed to the roof of the mouth. That is, if one is
       a human being. Directions for other entities are naturally
       different."
       From these quotes (taken from Lovecraft's letters), one might
       conclude that the second pronunciation mentioned above is the most
       correct of the three.
     * Q: Who is H.P. Lovecraft?
       A: Howard Phillips Lovecraft was a writer of weird fiction who
       wrote most of his tales during the 1920s and 1930s. He was born on
       August 20, 1890 in Providence, Rhode Island, where he spent most
       of his life. He was briefly married and lived in Brooklyn for two
       years. After this he returned to Providence where he died on March
       15, 1937.
     * Q: Where is H.P. Lovecraft buried?
       A: Lovecraft is buried in Swan Point Cemetery, Providence, R.I.,
       which is just northeast of the Brown University and College Hill
       area. He and his parents are in the plot belonging to his maternal
       grandfather, Whipple Van Buren Phillips. Once you enter the
       cemetery, follow Holly Avenue straight back to Junction Avenue,
       where you make a left. Soon after this, Pond Avenue curves off to
       the right. Follow Pond until it intersects Avenue B. The family
       plot is on the east side of the intersection of these two avenues.
       Lovecraft's grave was unmarked until the mid-1970s when fans
       raised funds for a tombstone. Prior to that, the only indication
       that he was buried there was his name inscribed on the back of the
       large family monument. On his tombstone is inscribed:
       
                              HOWARD PHILLIPS
                                 LOVECRAFT
                              AUGUST 20, 1890
                               MARCH 15, 1937
                                -----------
                             'I AM PROVIDENCE'
       The "I am Providence" quote is from a letter he wrote to James F.
       Morton dated May 16, 1926.
     * Q: What are the addresses of the various companies or
       organizations which are mentioned throughout this FAQ?
       A: The following address list is presented because folks have
       found it difficult to pick and choose addresses from within the
       FAQ. Also, due to repeated mentionings of various companies and
       organizations, this list will prevent having multiple postings of
       their addresses.

     * Q: What stories should I begin with?
       A: Bob Cannard (BobTheMigo@aol.com) conducted a poll to determine
       which tales would be best for new readers. The top five suggested
       tales were:
         1. The Call of Cthulhu
         2. The Shadow over Innsmouth
         3. The Dunwich Horror
         4. At the Mountains of Madness
         5. Pickman's Model
       However, I felt that "At the Mountains of Madness" was a bit of a
       read for those just being introduced to Lovecraft. This anomaly
       might be due to the small number of voters involved (12). As such,
       I would recommend "The Haunter of the Dark" in its place (which
       received fairly high marks in the poll).
     * Q: Where can I find Lovecraftian fiction and articles?
       A: The most accessible versions of Lovecraft's tales are paperback
       editions by Ballantine/Del Rey. They are very inexpensive and are
       available in most large bookstores.
       The definitive versions of H.P. Lovecraft's stories (as well as
       Mythos fiction by other authors) are available in hardback from
       Arkham House Publishers, Inc. They include:
       The Dunwich Horror and Others                (037-8) $19.95
       At the Mountains of Madness and Other Novels (038-6) $19.95
       Dagon and Other Macabre Tales                (039-4) $19.95
       The Horror in the Museum and Other Revisions (040-8) $19.95
       The prices listed include shipping and handling and these books
       can be ordered directly from Arkham House. S.T. Joshi's index to
       the tales collected above is available from Necronomicon Press.
       Paperback anthologies from other publishers can be found in many
       bookstores. Other important publishers of Lovecraftiana are:
          + Necronomicon Press
          + Pagan Publishing
          + Fedogan & Bremer
          + Borgo Press
          + Chaosium (their '6000' series of products)
     * Q: Why is Volume III of Lovecraft's letters so hard to find?
       A: Volume III of Arkham House's Selected Letters is long out of
       print, as is volume I. Here's the publication history of these
       five volumes:
       Book                 1st Edition  2nd Edition  Total
       Selected Letters I   2,504 (1965) 3,000 (1974) 5,504
       Selected Letters II  2,482 (1968) 3,000 (1974) 5,482
       Selected Letters III 2,500 (1971)     ---      2,500
       Selected Letters IV  5,000 (1976)     ---      5,000
       Selected Letters V   5,000 (1976)     ---      5,000
       As you can see, Arkham House reprinted volumes I and II in 1974
       and probably intended to simply delay reprinting volume III until
       after volumes IV and V came out. I've seen copies of volume III
       sell for anywhere from $80 to $400.
     * Q: What Lovecraft information is available at World Wide Web
       sites?
       A: There are dozens of Lovecraft-related pages dotting the web.
       Many of them consist of nothing but collections of links, but
       those in the list below provide their own unique information.

     * Q: Where can I get a copy of the Necronomicon?
       A: "The" Necronomicon, i.e. the book written about by Lovecraft,
       cannot be found anywhere because it was never written - anyone who
       disagrees with this statement is invited to produce a copy.
       Several commercial Necronomicons have been published. The easiest
       to find is the Avon paperback by Simon, which is mainly a re-hash
       of Sumerian mythology with a few Mythos names dropped in; some
       practitioners of magick consider it useful, but it has very little
       to do with Lovecraft's creation.
       The 1973 Owlswick Press edition, prefaced by L. Sprague de Camp,
       is reputedly a facsimile of an old manuscript but actually
       contains only 8 pages of Arabic text repeated over and over again.
       "H. R. Giger's Necronomicon" is a collection of that gentleman's
       art; if you are not familiar with his work, watch the "Alien"
       movie.
       "The Necronomicon: The Book of Dead Names" by Colin Wilson et al
       claims to be the rediscovered work.
       There are many known library references to the Necronomicon by
       Abdul Alhazred, Michael Tice's entry at UCLA being perhaps the
       most notorious; these are pranks engineered by students or
       librarians. The newsgroups alt.necromicon and alt.necronomicon are
       suggested for those who wish to discuss the historical
       authenticity, translations and publications of this tome.
     * Q: What is the etymology of the word "Necronomicon"?
       A: Lovecraft himself provides us a translation in a letter to
       Harry O. Fischer dated late February, 1937: "The name Necronomicon
       (necros, corpse; nomos, law; eikon, image = An Image [or Picture]
       of the Law of the Dead) occurred to me in the course of a dream,
       although the etymology is perfectly sound."
       Some will argue that this etymology is not perfectly sound, but
       since Lovecraft invented the book, I feel his etymology is the
       correct one. However, for those interested in a more correct
       translation, the following was provided by S. A. T. Haldane
       (sah@dl.ac.uk):
       Nekros/nekr-o- (noun) 'dead (person)'
       nomos/nom-o- (noun) 'law', 'custom'
       -ikos/-ike/-ikon (adjectival suffix) 'to do with', 'concerning',
       hence nekr-o- + nom-o- + -ikos > nekronomikos (adjective)
       concerning the customs of the dead'. Functioning as a noun in the
       neutral gender, to Nekronomikon '(The Thing) Concerning the
       Customs of the Dead'.
