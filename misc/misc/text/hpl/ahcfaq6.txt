   Besides motion pictures and games, Lovecraft has crept into many other
   areas of entertainment, including television shows, radio, books on
   tape, music, and comic books.
     * Q: What radio shows have included Lovecraft or the Mythos?
       A: Before Lovecraft's tales were adapted for the screen, they were
       dramatised on radio.
          + "The Mark Ratcliffe show" on Radio1 FM, UK
               o 'Joolz' narrates the story "Cool Air" in Spring 1994
          + "Quiet Please" (1948)
               o Lovecraft mentioned in one episode
          + "Suspense" (1945)
               o Radio adaptation of "The Dunwich Horror"
          + "Thriller"
               o Radio adaptation of "Pigeons from Hell" by Robert Howard
                 (PFH was included in 'Cthulhu: The mythos and kindred
                 horrors, and thus the radio reading is included here)
          + "The Young Man of Providence" on BBC Radio 4, UK
               o 1 hour documentary about Lovecraft and his creation,
                 broadcast in UK some years ago. Spooky sound effects and
                 short quotes from various stories. Cthulhoid quotes
                 rendered in a gutteralised accent, which worked
                 surprisingly well. It may still be stashed away in the
                 BBC sound archives.
               o Credits:
                 Writer: Mike Walker
                 Director: Shaun McLaughlin

            This is a radio-show-like dramatization set in the 1940's, as
            opposed to a literal reading of the story. Also includes Brad
            Linaweaver's "The Competitor".

            The "Fungi From Yuggoth" reading can be ordered for $11.00
            total (S&H included) from Fedogan & Bremer. I consider it to
            be the second best of the Lovecraft tapes available, "The
            Thing on the Doorstep" narrowly being first.
          + The Haunter of the Dark

               o Stories include "Cool Air" (H.P. Lovecraft), "The Dead
                 Man" (F. Leiber), "The House" (A. Maurois), "The
                 Academy" (D. Ely), and "The Devil Is Not Mocked" (M.
                 Wellman).
               o There are more tapes in this series, which include
                 Lovecraft's "Pickman's Model" and Derleth's "House -
                 with Ghost" and "The Dark Boy".
          + Roddy McDowell Reads the Horror Stories of H.P. Lovecraft
               Year: 196?
              Media: Album
            Read By: Roddy McDowell
            Stories currently unknown.
          + Tales of the Unnatural
              Media: Tape
               Time: 1:00

            Two stories, "Burgerland" by Aron Abrams and "The Cave" by
            Vicki Hendrickson are followed by Lovecraft's "The Rats in
            the Walls". The first stories are poor at best, and the
            narrators often stumble over their lines. The Lovecraft story
            suffers from being abridged, and what remains of it is read
            at top speed. I also noticed that at no time is the cat,
            "NiggerMan", referred to by name.
          + The Thing on the Doorstep

            Company: Voice At Work, Inc. (see "Jay Gregory")
              Price: $15
            The full title of the tape is "The Lovecraft Tapes, stories
            by H. P. Lovecraft, Vol. I, 'The Thing on the Doorstep'". I
            consider this the best of the Lovecraft tapes available, and
            hope to see more volumes.
          + The Thing on the Doorstep

     * Q: What music is available where the band, or song title, or
       lyrics make reference to Lovecraft or the Mythos?
       A: Although it would seem that Lovecraft's influence has crept
       into many musical works, it might be more correct to say that many
       of these works were inspired more by the hoax Necronomicons. An
       excellent article on Lovecraft-inspired music is Allen Mackey's
       "Disciples of Zann", which appeared in the Eastertide 1995 issue
       (number 89) of Crypt of Cthulhu.
          + The Bevis Frond

                      references to "The King in Yellow".
               o Imaginos
                    # "I Am the One You Warned Me Of" -- The "Starry
                      Wisdom" is mentioned.
                    # "Les Invisibles" -- The reference to "beneath the
                      polar mountain" may be a reference to Lovecraft's
                      _At the Mountains of Madness_. Also, the lyrics
                      "the empress lay sleeping to the rhyme of the star
                      clock" may refer to the return of the Great Old
                      Ones.
                    # "In the Presence of Another World" -- The phrase

                    # "The Seige and Investiture of Baron Von
                      Frankenstein's Castle at Wisseria" -- The "Starry
                      Wisdom" is mentioned.
          + Caravan
               o For girls who grow plump in the night -- The name

                 Cthulhu and mentiones that "he sleeps beneath the
                 waves".
          + The Darkest of the Hillside Thickets (Joe Fulgham) -- A
            Vancouver "punky surf" band whose lyrics don't just make

            Ones", "War in Heaven", "From Beyond", and "The Book of

                      by a short story by H.P. Lovecraft." It's actually
                      a bit boring and monotonous when compared to the
                      sort of music that story should inspire.

     * Q: What music do players of Call of Cthulhu recommend as
       background music to add to the eerie mood of the game?
       A: Of course, this varies from Keeper to Keeper, but there are
       some pieces that many agree on. Editor's note: I was deluged with
       music posts and e-mails... For my sanity and timeliness, I stopped
       including new ones... If anyone else wants to archive them and
       send me a formatted copy, fine. Otherwise, the below list will
       have to do.
          + "2001: A Space Odyssey" soundtrack
          + "Absinthe" by Naked City - ambient, disturbing, creepy music.
          + "Akira" soundtrack - Japanese Anime movie by Katsuhiro Otomo,
            especially 'Mutation'.
          + "Apollo" by Brian Eno - strange and grand.
          + "Cacophany" by Rudimentary Peni - Punk/weird music.
          + "Dark Themes From Beyond" - CD available via Wizard's Attic.
          + "Das Klavierwerk" by Arnold Schoenberg - splintered,
            plaintive music.
          + "Fog Tropes/Gradual Requiem" by Ingram Marshall - modern
            elec. music, strange sounds.
          + "Koyanisquaatsi" by Phillip Glass - Lots of that arpeggiated
            diminished chord.
          + "The Nephilim" by Fields of the Nephilim - Dark, broody,
            gothic music.
          + "PAGTAPE" by Pagan Publishing - 10 minutes of menace and
            malignity
          + "The Planets" by Holst - Mars & Uranus good for action,
            Neptune good for alien feeling, Saturn good for envisioning
            Cthulhu attacking.
          + "Pure" by Godflesh - Distant mournful vocals
          + "Second Edition" by Public Image Limited - Chanting vocals,
