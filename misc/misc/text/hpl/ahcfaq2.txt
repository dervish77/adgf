   This portion of the alt.horror.cthulhu FAQ was brought to you by
   Donovan K. Loucks (dloucks@primenet.com). This document was last
   updated on June 18, 1997.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
     * Q: What is this newsgroup about?
       A: The group is specifically about the creatures, people, places
       and legends of the Cthulhu Mythos (or Cthulhu Cycle) as reported
       in the fiction of Howard Phillips Lovecraft and numerous other
       authors. More generally, the newsgroup also covers other aspects
       of H.P. Lovecraft's life and work, works by other authors of
       related style and content, and Mythos-related organizations and
       products (real or fictional) such as Miskatonic University, music,
       games, tee shirts, and posters.
     * Q: What is Cthulhu?
       A: The best answer to this question is found in Lovecraft's tale
       "The Call of Cthulhu". Cthulhu is a monstrous entity who lies
       "dead but dreaming" in the city of R'lyeh, a place of
       non-Euclidean madness presently (and mercifully) sunken below the
       depths of the Pacific Ocean. Cthulhu appears in various monstrous
       and demonic forms in early myths of the human race. Racial memory
       preserves Him as humanity's most basic nightmare. Cthulhu is the
       high priest of the Great Old Ones, unnatural alien beings who
       ruled the Earth before humanity formed, worshipped as gods by some
       misguided people. It is said that They will return, causing
       worldwide insanity and mindless violence before finally displacing
       humanity forever.
     * Q: How is "Cthulhu" pronounced?
       A: There are basically three different pronunciations that I have
       heard, other pronunciations being slight modifications on these.
       The most commonly heard pronunciation is that suggested by
       Chaosium, makers of the "Call of Cthulhu" roleplaying game. On the
       back of many of their gaming products is printed the phrase, "Can
       you say kuh-THOOL-hoo?".
       Another pronunciation is that used by several Lovecraftian
       scholars. This form is based on Lovecraft's revision tales where
       Cthulhu is often referred to as "Clooloo" or "Clulu".
       Unfortunately, this form does not have a sound representing the
       "th" combination.
       The pronunciation that I prefer is a compromise between these two.
       The "h" sounds are aspirated, thus the "th" is not as in "them" or
       "thin", but two separate sounds. The first four letters of the
       word are run together in something like a sneezing sound,
       "K't'hoo-lhoo".
       According to H.P. Lovecraft:
       "The actual sound - as nearly as human organs could imitate it or
       human letters record it - may be taken as something like
       Khlul'-hloo, with the first syllable pronounced gutturally and
       very thickly."
       "The best approximation one can make is to grunt, bark, or cough
       the imperfectly formed syllables Cluh-Luh with the tip of the
       tongue firmly affixed to the roof of the mouth. That is, if one is
       a human being. Directions for other entities are naturally
       different."
       From these quotes (taken from Lovecraft's letters), one might
       conclude that the second pronunciation mentioned above is the most
       correct of the three.
     * Q: Who is H.P. Lovecraft?
       A: Howard Phillips Lovecraft was a writer of weird fiction who
       wrote most of his tales during the 1920s and 1930s. He was born on
       August 20, 1890 in Providence, Rhode Island, where he spent most
       of his life. He was briefly married and lived in Brooklyn for two
       years. After this he returned to Providence where he died on March
       15, 1937.
     * Q: Where is H.P. Lovecraft buried?
       A: Lovecraft is buried in Swan Point Cemetery, Providence, R.I.,
       which is just northeast of the Brown University and College Hill
       area. He and his parents are in the plot belonging to his maternal
       grandfather, Whipple Van Buren Phillips. Once you enter the
       cemetery, follow Holly Avenue straight back to Junction Avenue,
       where you make a left. Soon after this, Pond Avenue curves off to
       the right. Follow Pond until it intersects Avenue B. The family
       plot is on the east side of the intersection of these two avenues.
       Lovecraft's grave was unmarked until the mid-1970s when fans
       raised funds for a tombstone. Prior to that, the only indication
       that he was buried there was his name inscribed on the back of the
       large family monument. On his tombstone is inscribed:
       
                              HOWARD PHILLIPS
                                 LOVECRAFT
                              AUGUST 20, 1890
                               MARCH 15, 1937
                                -----------
                             'I AM PROVIDENCE'
       The "I am Providence" quote is from a letter he wrote to James F.
       Morton dated May 16, 1926.
     * Q: Where does August Derleth stand in all this?
       A: August Derleth was one of H.P. Lovecraft's friends and fans. He
       was directly responsible for preventing Lovecraft's works from
       falling into oblivion, and co-founded Arkham House for that
       purpose; for this we owe him a zillion kudos. He wrote many tales
       within the Cthulhu Mythos; some of these are based on outlines or
       fragments by Lovecraft, such as "The Lurker at the Threshold".
       The controversy over Derleth is that in his tales he adds a number
       of concepts to the Cthulhu Mythos which appear to be at odds with
       Lovecraft's conception. He introduced the Elder Gods,
       ultra-powerful beings who had imprisoned the Great Old Ones and
       who protect the human race from their machinations. He also turned
       the Great Old Ones into elemental beings, contrary to Lovecraft's
       concept of them as unnatural alien invaders, and raising awkward
       questions such as "If Cthulhu is a water elemental, why is he
       imprisoned by the sea?" Whereas Lovecraft depicted the Mythos
       creatures as horrible, alien, and incomprehensible, Derleth
       sometimes made them understandable and almost likeable -- contrast
       Lovecraft's "The Shadow over Innsmouth" with Derleth's "The Seal
       of R'lyeh".
       While Derleth deserves praise for his promotion of Lovecraft, his
       guardianship of the Lovecraft canon was not without its problems.
       Derleth set out to control not only the publication of Lovecraft's
       work (a move of dubious legality), but also the printing of
       Cthulhu Mythos stories, Lovecraft criticism, and other articles
       about HPL. For this reason, many Lovecraft scholars have become
       vocal opponents of August Derleth and his policies toward
       Lovecraft. Although Derleth's ideas are anathema to many Lovecraft
       purists, his contribution to and influence over the development of
       the Cthulhu Mythos has been immense and ongoing.
     * Q: Does anyone actually take Lovecraft or Mythos fiction as fact?
       A: This is a loaded question. To answer it, I will assume that
       Lovecraft (et al) created the core of the Mythos, as well as
       numerous tomes, but mixed in a generous helping of real-life
       people, places, and things. As an example, "The Golden Bough" is a
       real book (in fact I own a copy of this, IMHO, boring text), but
       the Necronomicon is not. So, though Lovecraft (et al) used "The
       Golden Bough" in their stories, this answer has nothing to do with
       whether or not anyone believes that the book exists. It does deal
       with those who believe that things like the Necronomicon exist,
       (as well as any ficticious race, place, tome, etc).
       To move on to the answer: Yes. Some folks take this fiction as
       'fact'. Here are the examples we have thus far:
          + The Church of Satan -- Although they don't proclaim to
            believe in "The Old Ones" (per se), they do believe in the
            symbology of "Cthulhu" as something worth basing two of their
            rituals upon. Said rituals are found in The Satanic Rituals,
            by Anton Szandor LaVey (Avon Books).
          + The Necronomicon Anti-FAQ by Colin Low -- Written in the same
            spirit as Lovecraft's own "History of the Necronomicon", but
            in much greater detail, this document has caused a
            considerable amount of confusion amongst those not "in the
            know". Colin Low refers to this as an Anti-FAQ, does not
            claim that it is someting to be believed, and openly admits
            that it is a hoax. It's at least worth a read-through for its
            application to the game "Call of Cthulhu" (see the "Games"
            part of this FAQ). It may be found at:
            http://www.digital-brilliance.com/necron/necron.htm
          + "The Oldest History of the World" by Benny Evangelist (1936)
            -- "The author of this book was found decapitated in his
            Detroit home on July 3, 1929, near the murdered remains of
            his family. Investigation revealed that Benny was the leader
            of a secretive cult, and had left behind a manuscript which
            he claimed to have been divinely inspired. The first part of
            this manuscript was later published. Yes, it sounds like your
            standard Mythos story, but this one really happened.
            "Anyway, the book above actually has little to do with the
            Mythos. I am noting it because at three points in the text, a
            book of black magic which is titled "Necromicon" or
            "Necronemicon" turns up. I haven't read it, so I can't say
            whether it's any good. I got that last bit of information
            from Colin Wilson's novel The Philosopher's Stone. Since
            Wilson claims not to make anything up, and since History
            wasn't his invention, I don't think it would hurt to tell you
            about this one, too." - Daniel Harms
            (harmsdm@ctrvax.vanderbilt.edu)
          + "Secrets of Atlantis" by Gabriel Guenon (1941) -- "Secrets
            was written shortly before its author's death. According to
            Wilson, it attempts to prove that Lovecraft was writing about
            things which really existed. Unfortunately, a brief check
            down at the ol' library has turned up the following
            information:
              a. It's not in print.
              b. It's not available through inter-library loan.
              c. The British Museum Library doesn't have it.
            My guess is that it was published in a limited edition in
            England, and never reached our shores. Or maybe all copies
            were destroyed by an evil cult. Take your choice." - Daniel
            Harms (harmsdm@ctrvax.vanderbilt.edu)
          + "The Satanic Lays" -- Contain 2 ceremonies to raise the Great
            Old Ones. The German ritual on electricity seems to allude to
            Lovecraft's quotes about the Old Ones, as well as to the
            Hounds of Tindalos.
          + Kenneth Grant:
               o "Aleister Crowley and the Hidden God" by Kenneth Grant
               o "Man, Myth and Magic". Kenneth Grant has a 2 page
                 article in the appendices. "Grant believes that
                 Lovecraft was in touch with Cthulhu & Co., who prompted
                 him to write his stories. He then cites other
                 cross-cultural influences which seem to point toward
                 this conclusion. Unfortunately, the man's an awful
                 Lovecraftian scholar, and his stuff's filled with
                 mistakes" - Daniel Harms (harmsdm@ctrvax.vanderbilt.edu)
          + The Esoteric Order of Dagon -- The following is the last
            public announcement I am aware of by the Esoteric Order of
            Dagon. It is posted with the permission of Ms. Crummett:
            STATEMENT OF THE YADDITH LODGE
            The Yaddith Lodge is at this time the only genuine and active
            Lodge of the Esoteric Order of Dagon (E.'.O.'.D.'.) and is
            entrusted to protect the reputation and integrity of the EOD
            during its present Period of Silence.
            The only members of the Yaddith Lodge are the three former
            Directors of the EOD.
            Any person not a member of the Yaddith Lodge claiming to be a
            member, to represent a Lodge, or to be the Director of the
            EOD is either self-deluded or consciously misleading and
            manipulating the uninformed.
            When the Period of Silence has ended the Yaddith Lodge will
            appoint a new Director and this person will then be
            authorized to open other authentic Lodges and confirm
            membership in the EOD.
            - Issued by the Yaddith Lodge, Vernal Equinox, 1993 e.v.
            (Signed) Steven Greenwood, Nina Crummett, Peter Smith
            The Esoteric Order of Dagon is therefore inactive at this
            time. I must stress that this organization is not to be
            confused with the amateur press association of the same name.
            [Contributed by: David Smith (EsoOrDagon@aol.com)]
          + The Miskatonick Society -- There is another group called the
            Miskatonick (sic) Society which has some overlap with the
            above group but is not a "magick" group. They publish a
            journal called 'The Silver Key' which is free to members.
            There are no dues or fees to belong to the Miskatonick
            Society but membership is by invitation only and limited.
            There is a branch in England as well as the U.S. I am not a
            member of this group but know many of the American members.
            They do not engage in graverobbing or acts of violence and
            only want to correspond with sane, rational, literate
            scholars of Lovecraftian/fringe subjects.
            These include Lovecraft, Machen, Kenneth Grant's books and
            theories, UFO cults and cranks, especially in relationship to
            Lovecraftian themes, the Jungian transpersonal forces of the
            unconscious as the "Great Old Ones', etc.
            Writers and artists interested in joining should enquire and
            perhaps include an example of their work (with SASE if they
            want it returned.) [Contributed by: David Smith

     * Q: What are the addresses of the various companies or
       organizations which are mentioned throughout this FAQ?
       A: The following address list is presented because folks have
       found it difficult to pick and choose addresses from within the
       FAQ. Also, due to repeated mentionings of various companies and
       organizations, this list will prevent having multiple postings of
