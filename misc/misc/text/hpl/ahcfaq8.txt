   The following information was culled from Lovecraftian tales. It
   includes references to Lovecraft's fictional towns, entities, and
   tomes, as well as a timeline of events in Lovecraft's fictional
   universe.
     * Q: What actual locations did Lovecraft base his fictional ones on?
       A: Four major towns and suggested real-life equivalents are:
       Arkham: Salem (with a pinch of Providence, RI)
       Dunwich: Wilbraham, Monson, and Hampden
       Innsmouth: Gloucester and Newburyport
       Kingsport: Marblehead
       It is probably wrong to take these equivalents too literally,
       since Lovecraft was never averse to using real-life locations in
       his tales (e.g. "The Case of Charles Dexter Ward" is set mainly in
       Providence, RI), and would have had good reason for making his
       fictional towns significantly different from real locations.
          + Arkham (Salem)
          + Dunwich (Wilbraham, Monson, and Hampden)
            A 2nd opinion:
            On the other hand, I always thought that Dunwich was based on
            Plasitow, Mass/NH, a few miles North of where Dunwich was
            supposed to be located. I visited there once or twice, and it
            looked pretty inbred to me.
            A 3rd opinion:
            Well, i always thought it was based on dunstable, mass.
            dunstable is in north-central massachusetts (actually a
            little east of central), is at least 50 years older than all
            the towns around it (dunstable founded in ~1650, most of the
            others around it ~1700), and there are lots of atmospheric
            areas in the town--old houses in various states of disrepair,
            huge gnarly (dude!) trees overhanging the roads, hilly old
            graveyards, swamps, that kind of stuff. finally, there's the
            name: DUNstable DUNwich?
          + Innsmouth (Gloucester and Newburyport)
          + Kingsport (Marblehead)
     * Q: Where is the Plateau of Leng?
       A: There are three suggested locations:
          + The first, described extensively in Lovecraft's "The
            Dream-Quest of Unknown Kadath", is in the far north of the
            Dreamlands and inhabited by unpleasant, cloven-hooved, horned
            men, and by an ancient monastery which contains "the high
            priest not to be described, which wears a yellow silken mask
            over its face" ("Celephais", Lovecraft).
          + The second, described in Lovecraft's "At the Mountains of
            Madness", is in Antarctica near the South Geomagnetic Pole,
            once inhabited by the Elder Things but now reserved for giant
            penguins and the occasional shoggoth.
          + The third location, referred to in Lovecraft's "The Hound"
            and seemingly the most popular location with other authors,
            is in the Himalayas and inhabited by a cult of cannibals. The
            three locations could be related through some quirk of
            space-time.
       According to Tierney's "House of the Toad", the Plateau may be
       found in China's Xinjiang (perhaps Xizang) Province. This is
       notable, because in Discovery magazine, there was an article about
       some Caucasian mummies bearing items like those found in the
       Ukraine found here. I seem to recall the Necronomicon saying
       something like "Leng is connected with many different times and
       places" (that quote's Lin Carter's invention, and I don't have it
       right here). Interesting stuff, though.
       According to Jack Chalker's "River of the Dancing Gods", the
       Plateau of Leng is in the upper Northwest of the world of the
       Dancing Gods.
     * Q: Where is Irem?
       A: Lovecraft mentions an "Irem, City of Pillars" in some stories.
       This probably has a Koranic source, as suggested by the following
       magazine item about an archeological discovery:
       "The Koran describes how the earth swallowed up a sumptuous but
       decadent `city of towers' called Iram....diggers can already see
       that the city center collapsed--as told in the Koran--because it
       was built over a limestone cavern used to store water." Identified
       with Ubar, frankincense-trading city in the Arabian Nights.
       (Jeanne Gordon & Fiona Gleizes, "The `Atlantis of the Sands',"
       Newsweek, 119:7, Feb. 17, 1992, p. 38.) - Donald Davis
       Also, an article in the October 1995 issue of Reader's Digest
       ("Search for the Lost City") describes how documentary film-maker
       Nick Clapp organized several expeditions to Oman to look for the
       lost city of Ubar. Ubar is believed by some to be "Irem, the
       many-towered city" mentioned in the Koran. Ubar, like the Biblical
       towns of Sodom and Gomorrah, was a town of great wickedness that
       Allah destroyed. Under the sands at the oasis of Shis'r, the
       researchers not only found pottery and glass artifacts, but the
       ruins of "eight towers, each perhaps 30 feet high...a lofty
       citadel...an octagonal fort..a wide court with a well in the
       center..."
       "Here's some information I remember from the last time I looked up
       Iram. There were once two brothers, Shaddid and Shaddad, who ruled
       a city somewhere in Arabia. Shaddid died, and Shaddad became
       arrogant and cruel. He decided that he would build a garden on
       Earth imitating the celestial paradise. When the garden was
       completed, Shaddad and all his retainers rode out in a procession
       to visit it. Before they could reach it, however, a great "noise
       from heaven" destroyed all of them, and the location of Iram has
       never been discovered. I wasn't familiar with that Arabian Nights
       reference; I'll have to look that up." - Daniel Harms
       (harmsdm@ctrvax.vanderbilt.edu)
     * Q: Who are the 'Great Old Ones'?
       A: The Great Old Ones are unique entities, alien to the Earth.
       Although each entity is unique, some (like Cthulhu) are actually a
       'leader' (or high priest? interpretations vary) of a race (i.e.
       Cthulhu is a "Great Old One" but he is of a race called, for lack
       of a better name, the "Spawn of Cthulhu"). The individual Great
       Old Ones, however, do not (necessarily) belong to the same race.
       However, Hastur has been referred to as the "half-brother" of
       Cthulhu. (No doubt this notion was started by August Derleth, and
       what may be the original reference to this appears in his "The
       Return of Hastur".)
       If a Great Old One is worshipped on Earth, it is generally by
       insane human cultists (as well as other races). Their worship
       likens them to gods, but they should not be confused with another
       Lovecraftian category, the Outer (sometimes called "Other") Gods.
       Nor with the Elder Gods. The Great Old Ones, while much more
       powerful than humankind, still seem to be 'outranked'(?) by the
       more powerful 'Outer Gods'.
       Along the same lines of name confusion comes the "Great Ones".
       These are a race of giant human-shaped creatures who rule the
       dreamlands. Not to be confused with "Great Old Ones".
       Lastly, "Old Ones" is a term used to refer (at various times) to
       either the "Great Old Ones" or to the ancient crinoid race found
       in The Mountains of Madness, in Antarctica. For future
       clarification, the crinoid race will be referred to as the "Elder
       Things" (another name that they are called.) The actual name of
       the race is a mystery. (They are called, also, the "Primordial
       Ones", but I digress.)
       A list of the Great Old Ones, and their respective homes and
       current locales follows (there are a lot for ?'s here, since I'm
       doing much of this from memory, just to get the ball rolling. This
       info will be checked for later editions of the FAQ)

     * Q: What various manifestations has Nyarlathotep taken?
       A: An exhaustive list in the making, full of spoilers if you
       haven't read the stories, here is the foundation:
          + AHTU (worshiped in Congo) In this form, Nyarlathotep appears
            as a huge mound of viscous material, with several golden
            tentacles sprouting from its central mass. Ahtu's worshipers
            are usually deformed or mutilated natives. He is called by
            using a golden bracelet usually separated innto two parts, to
            prevent Ahtu from being summoned by accident. ("Than Curse
            the Darkness," Drake; "Dead of Night," Herber (C).)
          + THE BEAST (Egypt) This form manifests itself only at one
            particular place in Egypt. It was the focus of a
            revolutionary cult in the Fourteenth Dynasty. (Fungi from
            Yuggoth, Herber (C).)
          + THE BLACK DEMON (Nowhere?) This is a black-furred, snouted
            monster which is destroyed by light. The being may be
            controlled by a summoner using certain talismans, though the
            user runs the risk of being attacked herself. ("One in
            Darkness," Isinwyll and Lyons (C).)
          + BLACK PHARAOH, (Egypt) A hairless man with dead black skin
            and hooves for feet. He is connected with the witch-cults of
            Western Europe. ("The Dreams in the Witch-House," Lovecraft.)
          + BLACK WIND (Africa?) At times, Nyarlathotep takes the form of
            the Black Wind, a great storm that can destroy crops, forest,
            and houses for miles around when he manifests. ("Kenya,"
            DiTillio and Willis (C).)
          + BLOATED WOMAN (China) In this form, N. appears as a huge,
            obese woman with five mouths and many tentacles. It carries
            the mystical Black Fan, with which it hides its unseemly bulk
            from humans until it has ensnared them. ("Shanghai," DiTillio
            and Willis (C).)
          + BRINGER OF PESTS (Egypt) Worshiped in Egypt's Twelfth
            Dynasty, this manifestation can only be described as a horde
            of huge spitting supernatural locusts. It is worshiped today
            by a group known as the Knights of the Silver Twilight. ("The
            Ten Commandments of Cthulhu Hunting," Monroe and Petersen
            (C). )
          + DARK DEMON (??) A form of Nyarlathotep that occasionally
            manifests itself through a contactee. It appears much as the
            Black Demon, but is larger and more cunning. It sometimes
            calls to those steeped in studies of black magic, promising
            them glory if they will allow him to enter their bodies. Of
            course, no reward comes to those possessed by this form of
            Nyarlathotep. ("The Dark Demon," Bloch.)
          + EFFIGY OF HATE (Africa) The Mighty Messenger was worshiped by
            one African tribe, to which he manifested himself through
            their war totems. This form is known to have some control
            over time. ("Regiment of Dread," Gillan. (C).)
          + THE FACELESS GOD (Egypt) In the elder days of the Egyptian
            civilization, Nyarlathotep was worshiped in the form of a
            winged sphinx with a featureless head which bore the triple
            crown of a god. The Faceless God was known to manifest itself
            through its idols. This cult was later suppressed by the
            other priesthoods, becoming nearly forgotten in the millennia
            following its dissolution. ("The Faceless God," Bloch.)
          + THE FLOATING HORROR (Haiti) This form of N. must manifest
            itself through the body of a specially prepared host. It
            appears as a red veined jellyfish-like floating organism of a
            bluish color. This avatar is connected with certain fringe
            voodoo cults. ("The Star-Pools," Attansio.)
          + HAUNTER OF THE DARK. See Lovecraft's story of the same name.
            (ed. note: wasn't Nyarlathotep also depicted in human form in
            the follow up story "The Shadow from the Steeple", by Bloch?)
          + MR. SKIN (Los Angeles): An immaculately dressed pimp. Unlike
            some other "Black Man" forms, this is wholly and unmistakably
            human, and appears to be a perfectly normal "person of color"
            (insert your favourite PC euphemism). He is closely
            associated with a cult of Shub-Niggurath.
          + NARLA (Near future, anywhere): An extremely sophisticated and
            detailed virtual reality simulation of a very beautiful white
            woman, this form invades VR systems. Her appearance is
            designed to distract the (typically male) sysadmin long
            enough for her to wrest total control of the system from him.
            Anyone using such a VR system when Narla invades is in very
            serious trouble. ("Star Bright, Star Byte," Sands)
          + SHUGORON (Malaysia) A black humanoid figure represented as
            playing a sort of horn. This being is revered by the
            Tcho-tcho people of Malaysia. ("Black Man with a Horn,"
            Klein; Escape from Innsmouth, Ross (C).)
          + SKINLESS ONE (Mesoamerica) In the guise of a flayed, skinless
            corpse, Nyarlathotep was worshiped among the Aztecs, to whom
            he was known as Xipe Totec. (?)
          + SMALL CRAWLER (India) A dwarfed human figure, with four arms
            and three tentacles for legs. Little else is known of him,
            except that he is mentioned in the Cthaat Aquadingen.
            ("Kenya," DiTillio and Willis (C).)
          + TALL, SWARTHY EGYPTIAN MYSTIC (USA) Spreads madness and
            chaos. ("Nyarlathotep," Lovecraft)
          + THING IN THE YELLOW MASK (Dreamlands) An entity draped in
            yellow silk, its only known manifestation occurred within the
            abandoned city of 'Ygiroth on Mount Lerion. (Possible link to
            the King in Yellow?) ("In 'Ygiroth," DeBill.)
          + WAILING WRITHER, a column of whirling black tentacles and
            screaming mouths, it is alluded to in some Hindu tales.
            (Escape from Innsmouth, Ross (C).)
     * Q: Where can I get a copy of the Necronomicon?
       A: "The" Necronomicon, i.e. the book written about by Lovecraft,
       cannot be found anywhere because it was never written - anyone who
       disagrees with this statement is invited to produce a copy.
       Several commercial Necronomicons have been published. The easiest
       to find is the Avon paperback by Simon, which is mainly a re-hash
       of Sumerian mythology with a few Mythos names dropped in; some
       practitioners of magick consider it useful, but it has very little
       to do with Lovecraft's creation.
       The 1973 Owlswick Press edition, prefaced by L. Sprague de Camp,
       is reputedly a facsimile of an old manuscript but actually
       contains only 8 pages of Arabic text repeated over and over again.
       H.R. Giger's Necronomicon is a collection of that gentleman's art;
       if you are not familiar with his work, watch the "Alien" movie.
       The Necronomicon: The Book of Dead Names by Colin Wilson et al
       claims to be the rediscovered work.
       There are many known library references to the Necronomicon by
       Abdul Alhazred, Michael Tice's entry at UCLA being perhaps the
       most notorious; these are pranks engineered by students or
       librarians. The newsgroups alt.necromicon and alt.necronomicon are
       suggested for those who wish to discuss the historical
       authenticity, translations and publications of this tome.
     * Q: What is the etymology of the word "Necronomicon"?
       A: Lovecraft himself provides us a translation in a letter to
       Harry O. Fischer dated late February, 1937: "The name Necronomicon
       (necros, corpse; nomos, law; eikon, image = An Image [or Picture]
       of the Law of the Dead) occurred to me in the course of a dream,
       although the etymology is perfectly sound."
       Some will argue that this etymology is not perfectly sound, but
       since Lovecraft invented the book, I feel his etymology is the
       correct one. However, for those interested in a more correct
       translation, the following was provided by S.A.T. Haldane
       (sah@dl.ac.uk):
       Nekros/nekr-o- (noun) 'dead (person)'
       nomos/nom-o- (noun) 'law', 'custom'
       -ikos/-ike/-ikon (adjectival suffix) 'to do with', 'concerning',
       hence nekr-o- + nom-o- + -ikos > nekronomikos (adjective)
       concerning the customs of the dead'. Functioning as a noun in the
       neutral gender, to Nekronomikon '(The Thing) Concerning the
       Customs of the Dead'.
     * Q: How about the Unaussprechlichen Kulten?
       A: First of all, the German title of this book is incorrect.
       "Unaussprechlichen Kulten" is simply wrong - it must be
       "Unaussprechliche Kulte".
       An earlier edition of the book carried the title:
       "Chains of Worship: how forged and broken; being a complete,
       graphic, and comparative history of the many strange beliefs,
       superstitious practices, domestic peculiarities, sacred writings,
       systems of philosophy, legends and traditions, customs and habits
       of men of the Unspeakable Cults throughout the ancient world."
       And from this it is clear that the original had the words,
       "unspeakable cults" appearing in the dative form: von den
       unaussprechlichen Kulten; wherupon later years saw the title
       shortened simply to, "Unaussprechlichen Kulten."
     * Q: What events occurred in the Mythos universe?
       A: Please note that this timeline has been modified extensively
       from the original FAQ timeline. Events that are not mentioned
       specifically in Lovecraft's works or that are the subject of
       scientific debate have been removed.
          + 2 billion BC: Elder Things arrive (crinoid Old Ones from
            AtMoM) ("At the Mountains of Madness")
            Possibly the Antarctic was already inhabited by something
            nasty (?) at the time, but the record is unclear. ("At the
            Mountains of Madness")
            Editor's note: This 'something nasty' smacks of Urm-At-Tawil
            (sp?). Anyone who has more information on this shall be
            blessed 'pi' times by Nyarlathotep.
