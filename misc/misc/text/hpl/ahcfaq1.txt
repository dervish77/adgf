     _________________________________________________________________
   
   This portion of the alt.horror.cthulhu FAQ was brought to you by
   Donovan K. Loucks (dloucks@primenet.com). This document was last
   updated on May 21, 1997.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
     * Q: What is a FAQ?
       A: A FAQ is a list of the "Frequently Asked Questions" for a
       particular Usenet group on the Internet. It is set up like you see
       here, with questions and answers, which basically prevent people
       from having to repeatedly answer the Frequently Asked Questions
       (by new users primarily).
     * Q: How will this FAQ be organized?
       A: Basically, this FAQ will be organized by subject matter, with
       each subject being uploaded to the internet as an individual
       posting. Thus, to get the whole FAQ you need to download each
       part. This is to allow people to pick and choose those FAQ
       subjects which interest them, and skip those which do not.
       This FAQ is slightly different than others on the internet, in
       that it contains MUCH more than just "Frequently Asked Questions".
       It also contains lists of information which people familiar with
       H.P. Lovecraft and the Cthulhu Mythos find interesting, thus
       making it a fairly lengthy set of files.
       Note: All addresses for companies or organizations are listed in
       one question in the "General" part of the FAQ.
       IMPORTANT
       Anytime that a question mark (?) appears in the FAQ, that means
       that the information has not been verified, or is somehow in
       question. If you have verifiable info on anything tagged with a
       '?', please e-mail that info to me, and I will try to fix it for
       the next FAQ posting.
     * Q: What are the sections of the FAQ?
       A: The FAQ sections are:

     * Q: How do I get a copy of the entire FAQ?
       A: There are several ways to obtain the FAQ, including:
          + Anonymous FTP: Using anonymous FTP lets you access Primenet's
            FTP server directly--this is where the FAQ is kept. It can be
            found in the "users/d/dloucks/ahc" directory and is stored in
            9 parts. Here are the details:
              Machine: ftp.primenet.com
                Login: anonymous
             Password: <your e-mail address>
            Directory: users/d/dloucks/ahc
                Files: all files beginning with "ahcfaq":

            ahcfaq1.txt_About       About, Sections,Credits

            ahcfaq8.txt_Mythos_Lore Locales, Entities, Tomes, Timeline
            Also, a ZIPped file called "ahcfaq.zip" contains all 9 parts.
          + The World Wide Web: Any web browswer can be used to access
            the FAQ. You may either use your web browser to obtain the
            FAQ via FTP, or you may access it via The H.P. Lovecraft
            Archive.
            FTP site:
            ftp://ftp.primenet.com/users/d/dloucks/ahc
            WWW site:
            http://www.primenet.com/~dloucks/hpl/internet/ahcfaq
          + E-mail Bots: For those who don't have FTP or WWW access, you
            can have portions of the FAQ e-mailed to you automatically by
            my e-mail bots. This process only requires that you send me
            (dloucks@primenet.com) an e-mail message with a particular
            Subject line. When your incoming message is detected by my
            e-mail bot, it will e-mail the appropriate section of the FAQ
            to you, and discard your message. With that in mind, don't
            bother sending any messages with contents, because I'll never
            get it. Also, since the mailbot handles everything
            automatically, don't hesitate to request all the parts of the
            FAQ. Here's a list of the exact Subject lines and what each
            gets you:

            FAQ: Mini-FAQ Answers to the top questions asked
     * Q: Will you e-mail me the FAQ?
       A: In general, no, due to time constraints. Anyone who has e-mail
       access can obtain the FAQ using my e-mail bots. If you've tried
       every other available method of getting the FAQ (FTP, WWW, e-mail
       bots) and have still had no success, I'll e-mail you the FAQ.
     * Q: Who contributed to this FAQ?
       A: This is (to me) the most important answer in this whole FAQ. As
       such, I hope to Cthulhu that I don't leave anyone out. If I do,
       please shout at me and I will make a formal apology, as well as
       righting the FAQ. I have tried to include everyone who gave input,
       even if it was a repeat of other peoples stuff, or if I already
       had the info. I feel that each effort deserves applause.
       I've included only names in this list. If you want to know who
       contributed what, e-mail me and request the more extensive list.

     * Q: Are all of the credited things above in this FAQ?
       A: If the appropriate section (i.e. General, Fiction, Movies,
       etc.) has been posted, then that credit should be in there. If I
       haven't finished the appropriate section yet, the credited item
       will be contained within it.
     * Q: What areas will be covered by future contributors?
       A: I have received notes from people who are interested in doing
       FAQ lists around specific areas of Lovecraft or Cthulhu stuff. I
       will list only the topics, and not their potential contributors,
       in case anyone is unable to contribute what they hoped to:
          + Books by Lovecraft; Books by other authors
          + Anthologies of short stories
     * Q: What subjects have people asked to see, but are not available
       at this time?
       A: There are a few obscure items that seem to have been touched
       upon, but not followed through. If anyone wants to tackle them,
       I'd love to see it.
          + Historical veracity and ficticious detailing of the numerous
            tomes mentioned in Lovecraft (et al) stories.
          + ISBN numbers of the books in the bibliographies
          + Historical information on deities/locations (i.e. Stonehenge,
            Easter Island, Nodens, etc) and the relation between reality
            and their ficticious mentionings.
          + Timeline (partially done)
