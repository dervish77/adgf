Background:

People in the near future (~50 yrs) have brain implants connected to wireless
transmitters, which hook into a global network (like a WAN).  This is what
the Internet has evolved into.  People spend much of their of time in
cyberspace, working, playing, etc.  

The effect of the system is very much like what it would be like if everyone
actually had psionic abilities.  People could transmit their thoughts, 
control objects, read other people's thoughts, etc.  Of course, thoughts
can be transmitted in private via secure channels over the network using
some kind of access code scheme.
