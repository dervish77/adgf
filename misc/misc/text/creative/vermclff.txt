			A Night in Vermillion Cliffs

			   by Brian Scott Lingard



	On a clear and stark Arizona night, I stopped by Vermillion Cliffs 
Motel and Restaurant.  There was a motley assortment of humanity scattered 
about the smoky watering hole.  A post-sixties biker sat drinking beer 
and asked for someone to provide a guiding light to replace his bike's burnt 
out headlamp.  A Navajo sat redfaced and inebriated with a quad of redneck 
boys celebrating life.  Some college coeds circled yet another table and 
sampled sou'western fair.  A dippy waitress with early signs of altzhiemer's 
mixed up orders and misguided guests to the wrong rooms.  A young oriental girl
cooked in the kitchen, turning cheese burgers into Swiss burgers.

	I sat dusty and sweaty in my vacationing canyon country garb and 
contemplated the early rustic decor of natural hued wood and majestic salmon 
leaping from taxidermic graves.  I had started this trip with the notion of 
seeking out some old indian ruins and investigating some legends about
the great Anasazi gods.  So far I had found nothing, not even a trace of
the cliff dwellings which supposedly lined the ridge behind this old 
motel.  The locals weren't much help either.  They were always suspicious of
strangers.  Many of them were indirect descendants of the original Anasazi
settlers of this region.  They always suspected strangers of grave robbing
and other such unsavory pasttimes.

	Mile after mile of sage brush and prickly pear cactus rolled by with 
lizards scurrying about in their scurrying about lizard ways.
