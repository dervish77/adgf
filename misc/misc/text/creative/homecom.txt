         A Homecoming

    by Brian Scott Lingard



Drifting through the starry sky
A love remembered comes to mind
So long it seems, to have gazed
Upon her face.  Her features etched
Like stone upon a rocky memory.
Such feeling long since shut away.
But a pang swells within my breast,
A hunger dwells deep in my chest.

A return to earth, many years absent,
A homecoming truly heaven sent.
Anticipation fills each thought
Trying to forget what was not.
The green mother appears to view,
A future bright and clear becomes anew.
Sunrise lifts my heart once more
And illuminates the love I adore.
