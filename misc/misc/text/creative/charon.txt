			    The Old One on Charon

			   by Brian Scott Lingard


Notes:

A pair of prospectors find an abandoned alien vehicle on the surface of
Pluto's moon, Charon.  The vehicle houses the frozen corpse of a bizarre
looking alien.  They decide that this could earn them some substantial 
money from the Science Corps.  And try to figure a way to salvage the 
alien ship.  

Almost immediately after boarding the ship, both men feel an increasing 
sense of dread and despair.  One man begins to see hallucinations -- strange,
nightmarish things, things he feared as a child.  He wants to forget about
the whole plan and leave as soon as possible.

The other man thinks his partner is loosing it and plots to get rid of him and
claim the ship for himself.  They struggle and just when the first man is 
about to die, the alien spectre appears, demanding to know who disturbs his 
slumber.

It seems he is a long forgotten God of the underworld, and was banished from
the Earth countless millenia ago.  He demands a sacrifice for this insolence.

The man who had the hallucinations manages to escape, but is forever haunted
by the memories of his partner's death.
