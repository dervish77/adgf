            The Suspended Village

           by Brian Scott Lingard



Overcast skies shadow the old, rustic shacks 
which cling desperately to the sheer rock cliffs.
The men of this lonely seashore village 
fish constantly to feed their families.  

Storm-ravaged fishing boats badly in need of repairs, 
lie scattered on the narrow beach,
but there is not enough money to patch the gaping holes.

The sky above the village is darkened 
by a heavy burden of black and grey clouds, 
skim across the sky briskly, 
and vanish below the distant ocean horizon.  

A scattered rock jetty lunges toward the open sea.  
The ocean's murky waters explode with violent waves 
against the rocks of the jetty.  

At night the sea glows with the phospherescence 
of tiny microscopic organisms.  On the rocks, 
patches of illumination are left by the retreating waters, 
preparing to attack the rocks again.

A storm creeps in over the waters, 
giving the ocean even more destructive force.  
The same destructive force has eroded the faces 
of the cliffs with deep scars through the passage of time.

Beneath the swiftly moving waters, 
the ocean teems with life of great variety.  
Each organism lives a life of its own, 
neither caring nor knowing about the old run-down, 
poverty-striken village, which hangs suspended in time 
above the vehement ocean.
