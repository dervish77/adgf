         Everlasting Peace

       by Brian Scott Lingard



A chill wind swept through the forest, 
whistling the trees, and rippling 
the waters of a small pond.  

A small whirl wind lifted 
a few dead leaves into a spiralling cone.  
They were dry and brittle, and easily 
disintegrated in the strong breeze.

Cottonball clouds drifted across the sky. 
Shadows crept slowly across the forest.  
Leaves floated down and accumulated.  

Underfoot, the matted leaves crunched
and twigs snapped.  Birds chirped 
their merry songs.  These sounds echoed 
throughout the deep forest.

Light reflected off a swiftly flowing river 
and seemed to hesitate before it collided 
with my eyes.  The river reflected the light 
into a sparkling spectrum of colors.  

Suspended high in the crystal blue sky, 
the sun cast a bright yellow light 
onto the forest.  Time stretched and slowed, 
until the fibers of time were ready to break.  
I gazed mystified at the ultimate peace 
that filtered through the forest ever so slowly.
