	Samuel Buckholt awoke with a start.  A proximity alarm was going 
off.  Flashing red and green lights illuminated the control compartment with 
an eerie glow.  Samuel tried to shake off the fatigue he felt after being 
rudely awakened.  He checked the near-range scanners.  Nothing.  He flipped 
the long range toggle.  Still nothing.  

	Suddenly, a horrifying tearing sound reverberated through hull of his
ship.  Luckily, Samuel was still strapped into the command chair, or else
he would have tossed around like all the other loose equipment and trash
that previously was stacked behind him.
