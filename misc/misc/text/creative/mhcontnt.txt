			We Must Have Content!

			  by Brian Lingard


   To fill the thousands of channels of OptiNet's entertainment system, 
the company employs thousands of people whose sole job is to plug their
brains into the thought interface system to supply their thoughts for
others to enjoy.  OptiNet's customers plug in at home to experience what
others are thinking at OptiNet's headquarters.  Some example channels are
The Paranoid Channel, The I'm a Swell Guy Channel, The Split Personality
Channel, The Perpetual Dreamer Channel.  Normally the thought supplier
must be physically connected to the system via a bundle of optical fibers, 
but there are remote links for getting impressions of places in the real
world.  But the remote links are very expensive and not 100 percent 
reliable.

   OptiNet is something of a monopoly and their only competition is a few 
scattered pirate thought networks.  These pirate networks are always trying
to steal away OptiNet's best and brightest thought stars.  Sometimes
the best and brightest are assasinated.

   Since the advent of thought networks, the various print and video media 
have suffered terribly.  Though there are still a few publishers which
deal solely in print and video media.  Some print media publishers charge
a hefty premium for anything delivered on paper, since paper media all but
disappeared about twenty years earlier.
