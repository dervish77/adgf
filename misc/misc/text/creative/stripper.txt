				The Stripper

			   by Brian Scott Lingard



SOME NOTES:

Stephenie strips at a local club called Manny's Lounge.  She is either a 
vampire or a sadistic demonic possessed murderer who flays her victims.  She 
is rarely seen in daylight.  She is raven haired, with striking features, and
has a flawless body.

George Cavendish is potentially her next victim.  He comes into Manny's for 
some suds and flesh.  He's never been interested in taking a girl home, he 
just likes to watch them.  But Stephenie is different.  He can't take his eyes 
off her and finds himself irrestibly drawn to her.

After Stephenie's set, George musters up his courage and talks with her at 
the bar.  After some conversation, he agrees to go with her to her place.

Once there, George quickly finds himself in her bedroom, where there are 
many kinky things about, "leather" straps, whips, chains, etc. Feeling
adventurous, George agrees to submit to some mild S&M.  But Stephenie has 
other ideas.

George innocently asks about the strange looking leathers straps which 
decorate her apartment.  She explains that they come from poor, feable 
creatures that deserve to die, while getting more earnest about her 
ministrations towards George.  George is gets nervous and asks to be freed.

Stephenie refuses and whips out a fierce looking knife and her appearance 
changes into that of a demon.  After a struggle, George's bounds get cut and 
he escapes.  Stephenie curses her loss and goes to "strip" her previous victim,
who has been aging in the back room.
