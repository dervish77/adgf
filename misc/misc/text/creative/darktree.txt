O Dark and Silent Tree

by Brian Scott Lingard


O dark and silent tree,
What wonders hast thou seen?
Thou stands in countenance
Whilst wind makes branches dance.

Thou hast seen war and peace,
Grazing sheep wrapped in fleece,
White snow under cold moon,
Hot Summer's day in June.

Thou hast seen beast and man,
Succumb to death's demand.
When Spring brings morning dew,
Dost life begin anew

O dark and silent tree,
What dost thou wish to be?
Bird with wings, dog with legs,
Could it be wooden pegs?
