     BIBLIOGRAPHY
          West Kingston, Rhode Island 1978-lst Donald M. Grant. 303p. Inscribed
          and signed. 4to. VG DJ. Fine. This is a bibliography of Smith's
          literary work. Smith 18 93-1961, 'has become one of the most imposing
          figures in the weird genre.' A California poet, short story writer,
          sculptor, and painter, Smith was close friend of H.P. Lovecraft who
          wrote of Smith: 'In sheer daemonic strangeness and fertility of
          conception , Clark Ashotn Smith is perhaps unexcelled by any other
          writer dead or living.' (dj) For an original artwork by Smith see
          item # in this catalogue. (bibliography occult art california scifi
          fantasy) (#LG1402) $150
