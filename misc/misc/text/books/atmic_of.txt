Online Ordering/Credit Card Orders

   * Email credit card information at your own risk. We suggest phoning or

     up to you.

     on US funds.
   * Money Orders must be drawn on US funds.

Adult Materials

   * All orders must be accompanied by an 18+ age statement. Please make sure
     you sign the age statement on the printed order form, or fill out the
     appropriate boxes on the online order form. Orders cannot be processed
     without your completed age statement and will be returned if not
     completed.

     Discrete packaging

   * All orders are shipped in plain packaging, either manila mailers or US
     Postal Service Priority Mail mailers.

Warning to International Customers

   * Customs Alert: Order adult materials at your own risk!
     Several English-speaking countries (mainly Canada & England) have customs
     regulations restricting the import of certain adult materials. Customs
     officials in those countries sometimes open packages and confiscate these
     adult materials. There is no recourse for the customer if a package is
     seized. Atomic Books cannot take responsibility for seized orders. Please
     be aware that you are ordering at your own risk. Atomic Books is not
     responsible for replacing or refunding orders seized by customs officials.
     Atomic Books suggests keeping orders to these countries under $50. Customs
     officials are not as likely to check smaller packages, plus you have less
     to lose if your order is seized. Most customers have succeeded in getting
     orders past customs. (We have had only 1 package to Canada seized in 1 1/2
     years of mail-order, but that can always change.) We mail all overseas
     packages from a home address and mark the package as a "gift" on the
     customs form, but once again, you are ordering at your own risk.

   * Atomic Books cannot accept responsibility for lost shipments outside the
     U.S.

Orders ship sooner if all items are in stock.
In the world of the alternative/underground small press it's almost impossible
to keep all items in stock at all times, due to the hard-to-find and
hard-to-obtain nature of these items. I honestly do my best and try to give you
as varied a selection as possible, even though it means dealing with over 100
distributors, zine producers, etc. Most orders ship out within 2 weeks of
receipt, but some do take 3-4 weeks. If you're anxious to know what's in and
what's out of stock, call us at 410.728.5490, and we can check the shelves
while we have you on the line. Email if you want, but calling always gets the
quickest response. We try to fill all backorders within 4 weeks.
