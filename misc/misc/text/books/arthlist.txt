                              ARTHURIAN BOOKLIST

   This is a reading list involving the Arthurian legend. For its
   original inception, I would like to thank the readers of the old
   Camelot mailing list (no longer in circulation). I wrote a good many
   of the original reviews when I was a member, but since then a number
   of people have submitted additional references for inclusion into this
   list. The very latest copy of this file may be found at
   http://www.io.com/user/tittle/books/arthurian.html

   My criterion for these books is that it be concerned with the Arthur
   legend in some way. I have several categories:


     * Fiction: novelizations of the Camelot legend, or novels that use
       elements of the legend.

     * Poetry: poetic renditions of the legend.

     * Non-Fiction and research: includes research into the origin of the
       legends, speculation on who the original characters might have
       been, studies and critiques of medieval sources, literary
       criticism, etc.

     * Medieval and Early Texts: original or modern translations of texts
       written before 16th century or so (an arbitrary divison point I
       used).

     * Periodicals: references that appear in magazines and articles.
       These are typically research notes.

     * Arthurian references: novelizations that use the legend in a minor
       way or as secondary characters.

     * Celtic Fiction: reworkings (novelizations) of traditional Celtic
       stories. I suppose I could have a category for research into
       celtic fiction, but the ones I consider relevant are in the
       non-fiction and research section above.

     * Organizations: finally, I provide a list of organizations dealing
       with the Camelot legend. This is not exhaustive; in fact, it's
       rather incomplete and I would love more information.

   In general, related stories are acceptable (such as Tristam and
   Iseult). Stories in other time periods are acceptable as long as they
   still center on the Arthur myth (Kennealy's Hawk's Gray Feather) or
   are talking about his return (Sir Machinery and others). References to
   Arthurian elements are also acceptable, but I do not put all of them
   in (a complete listing would be very large!); only the ones that seem
   interesting. The Celtic works are included, because many of them
   apparently provide an early genesis for the Arthurian stories, and
   others are stories derived from minor characters in the Arthurian
   stories (or perhaps the other way around, characters from well known
   stories got honorable mention in these later stories --- who can
   tell?).

   Disclaimer: I have not vouched for the accuracy of each and every
   entry in this list. If you find mistakes or have additional
   information on a reference, by all means, let me know. I likewise
   appreciate any additions to this list. Send them to the addresses at
   the end of this posting.

   Also please note that for some books their mere inclusion into this
   bibliography constitutes a spoiler of sorts. Don't say you haven't
   been warned!

   mailing list), Ed Aubry, Landen Bain, Richard Barber, Ron Bean, Wendy

     _________________________________________________________________

Fiction

   Arthur Sex #7: The Erotic Adventures of King Arthur. Castle of Ill
   Repute: Part one of two. This is a comic book. More issues? It is
   actually fairly faithful to Malory. Unsure whom to credit.

   The Romance of King Arthur (Mayflower, 1979. Reprint of 1917 Edition.
   ISBN 08317-7460-6.)

   ab Hugh, Dafydd. Arthur War Lord (Avon Books, 1994. ISBN
   0-380-77028-8.) Part one of two. Two present day people find
   themselves catapulted back in time, replaying events at Camelot with
   history at stake.

   Publishing Enterprises, 1993 (First published 1953).

   Ashe, Geoffrey. The Finger and the Moon. St. Albans: Panther Books,
   1975 (First published: Great Britain: William Heinemann, 1973).
   Geoffrey makes himself a character in this one. He organizes a
   ritual/play based on the Grail myth. (There's more to it than that, of
   course.)

   Ashley, Mike, The Pendragon Chronicles (Peter Bedrick Books, New York,
   1991. ISBN 0-87226-228-6. paperback.) Anthology includes stories by
   Andre Norton, John Steinback and Jane Yolen.

   Publishers, 1992. Another anthology by the author of The Pendragon
   Chronicles. Van Asten, Gail. The Blind Knight. New York: Ace Books,
   1988.

   Attanasio, A. A. Kingdom of the Grail. New York: HarperCollins, 1992.

   Auckland: Penguin Books: 1992 (First published in the USA by Harper &
   Row, 1990).

   Berger, Thomas, Arthur Rex. This retelling of the Arthur legend is
   somewhat reminiscent of the movie "Excalibur" in feel.

   Blaylock, James P. The Paper Grail. New York: Berkley Publishing
   Group, 1992 (First published: 1991). Bond, Nancy. A String in the
   Harp. New York: Penguin Books, 1987 (First published by Atheneum in
   1976).

   Borowsky, Marvin, The Queen's Knight (Random House, New York, 1955 -
   probably out of print). An interesting Arthur, who begins as a
   middle-aged bumpkin, crowned to be a puppet to a group of regents. All
   in all, this novel is somewhat uneven but quite readable.

   Bradley, Marion Zimmer, The Mists of Avalon (Del Rey. Ballantine
   Books, New York, 1982. ISBN 0-345-35049-9. Hardcover and trade
   paperback.) A female oriented and positive rendition of the Arthurian
   legend. Considerably more sympathetic to pagan religions (although
   depicted as modern neopaganism) than to Christianity.

   Bradshaw, Gillian, Hawk of May, Kingdom of Summer, In Winter's Shadow
   (Menthuen Paperbacks, Great Britain also Signet Books, 1980 also
   hardcover by Simon and Schuster.) The story of Gwalchmai, one of
   Arthur's Knights. He is god-touched with fighting madness and is one
   of the brothers of Medraut (Mordred). Down the Long Wind is the single
   book volume version of the three books.

   Milano, Italia; Copyright by Victor Canning 1976, 1977, 1978, and for
   the Italian edition by the publisher in 1990 (first edition, of the
   Italian translation, June 1990). An "Arthur as Celtic Chieftain" book,
   with nice twists.

   Carlsen, Chris. Berserker: The Bull Chief. London: Sphere Books, 1977.


   Carmichael, Douglas, Pendragon: an Historical Novel (Blackwater Press,
   New York, dist. by Exposition Press, 1977). Arthurian romances --

   Daughter. Out of print.

   Christian, Catherine, The Pendragon (Warner Books, 1978.) A story told
   by Bedivere in his old age recalling the golden days of Camelot.
   Unfortunately this results in a lackluster story. Aside from the
   intrusiveness of the story framed by Bedivere's old age, it's a decent
   retelling. Takes the "Celts reclaiming Romanized Britain" slant.

   Cochran, Molly and Warren Murphy. The Forever King. Tor Books, 1993.
   ISBN 0-812-51716-4. The return of Arthur to present day, woven in with
   the story as it happened long ago. Beautifully told.

   Arthur's return in modern day.

   Ontario, Aukland: Penguin Books, 1989. First published: Canada:

   Ford, John M. The Dragon Waiting: A Masque of History. New York: Avon
   Books, 1985 (First published: 1983).

   Finkel, George, The Twilight Province (London: Angus & Robinson,

   northern Arthur based on the Bamburgh Castle, Newcastle/Tyne area of
   northeastern Britain.

   London: William Collins, 1979).

   Gemmell, David. Ghost King and Last Sword of Power. A fictional
   account of the life and times of Arthur, bearing little resemblance to
   the usual myths.

   Gloag, John, Artorius Rex (New York: St. Martin's, 1977.) This is the
   final volume in a late Roman trilogy with two "pre-Arthurian" novels
   titled The Caesar of the Narrow Seas and The Eagles Depart. Artorius
   Rex is another Romano-Celtic tale which attempts a historical
   reconstruction.

   Godwin, Parke, The Last Rainbow, Fire Lord, Beloved Exile (Bantam).
   The characters are terrific, the sense of time and place eye opening.
   Arthur in the beginning is a native officer in the Roman legions
   guarding the northern borders. First published as short stories in
   Fantastic Sept. 1977, and in The Fire When it Comes (Garden City,
   Doubleday 1984).

   Griffiths, Paul. The Lay of Sir Tristam. London: Chatto & Windus,
   1991. ISBN 07011 3570 0. A very exciting book which at best can be
   described as meta-fiction. It takes on the whole problematic that the
   Arthurian/Tristam tradition presents.

   Gross, Gwen, Knights of the Round Table (Illustrated by Norman Green,
   Random House, New York, 1985).

   Haar (Hoar?), J. T. King Arthur (New York: Crane Russak, c.1967,

   Hanson, Charles Henry, Stories of the Days of King Arthur (With
   illustrations by Gustave Dore, T. Nelson, London/Edinbugh/New York,
   1898).

   Hastings, Selina, Sir Gawain and the Loathly Lady (Lothrop, Lee &
   Shepard Books, New York, 1985). ISBN 0-7445-0295-0. This is

   Gawain and the Green Knight is also available by the same author.

   Hawke, Simon [Nicholas Yermakov], The Wizard of 4th Street (1987), The
   Wizard of Whitechapel (1988), The Wizard of Sunset Strip (1989), The
   Wizard of Rue Morge (1990), The Samurai Wizard (1991), The Wizard of
   Santa Fe (1991), The Wizard of Camelot (1993). New York, Warner
   Books. Premise: There was a magical alien species which bred with
   humans long, long ago. The descendants of these unions were humans
   with magical abilities. Merlin was a half-breed, as was Morgan LeFay.
   Since magic and technology cannot co-exist, magic went dormant as
   technology increased. After the fall of technology, magic returned and
   Merlin revived. Unfortunately, the alien species discovered that
   Necromancy produces powerful magic and they are now known as demons.
   Merlin has to recruit and train magical humans to thwart their plans.
   Appearances by Merlin, Morgan Le Fay and Mordred.

   Humble, William F. A Tale of Arthur (Anthony Blond, London, 1967).

   Hunter, Jim. Percival and the Presence of God. London and Boston:
   Faber and Faber, 1978.

   Jeter, K. W. Morlock Night. New York: DAW Books, 1979.

   Johnson, Barbara Ferry. Lionors. New York: 1975.

   Jones, Courtway, In the Shadow of the Oak King. It apparently tries to
   tell the story in a historically 'realistic' setting (i.e., without
   grafting the high middle ages onto sixth century Britain).

   Jones, Courtway. The Witch of the North. New York: Simon and Schuster,
   1994. Copyright: 1992. Sequel to In the Shadow of the Oak King.

   Jones, Mary J., Avalon (The Naiad Press, ISBN: 0-941483-96-7, 1991).
   This is set in the closing days of King Arthur's reign and mostly
   concerns the Lady of the Lake at that time (Argante, from Layamon) her
   predecessor is Nimue), with some recounting of her childhood.
   Definitely a feminist reading, and not as well done as Mist of Avalon,
   for example. It is also curiously incomplete. More books may be
   planned.

   Kane, Gil and John Jakes. Excalibur!. No relation to film of same name
   and approximate year.

   Karr, Phyllis Ann. The Idylls of the Queen. New York: Ace Books, 1982.


   Katz, Welwyn Wilton, The Third Magic (Groundwood Books/Douglas &
   McIntyre, ISBN (bound): 0-88899-068-5 (pbk): 0-88899-126-6, 1988). A
   "young adult" book, this one has one of the more imaginative
   retellings of the Arthurian legend.

   Kennealy, Patricia, The Hawk's Gray Feather (ROC (division of Penguin
   Books), ISBN 0-451-45053-1, 1990). First in The Tales of Arthur, a
   series in which the later books have not yet been published. Builds
   upon the world of The Silver Branch, The Copper Crown and The Throne
   of Scone in which the Sidhe were aliens. This book is set much
   earlier. A good fantasy/SF blend.

   Kuncewicz, Maria. Tristan: A Novel. New York: George Braziller, 1974.

   Landis, Arthur H. Camelot in Orbit. New York: DAW Books, 1978. Also
   Home--To Avalon (1982), The Majick of Camelot (1981), A World Called
   Camelot (1976), all published by DAW Books.

   Lanier, Sidney, ed., King Arthur and His Knights of the Round Table,
   (Grosset & Dunlap, 1950. ISBN 0-448-06016-7.) A reasonable children's
   version. The Scribner, New York edition is illustrated by N.C. Wyeth.
   Original copyright in 1924.

   Lang, Andrew, Tales of the Round Table (London, New York : Longmans,
   Green, 1923). Based on the tales in the Book of Romance edited by
   Andrew Lang.

   Latymer, Baron Francis Burdett Thomas Coutts-Nevill, The Romance of
   King Arthur, (London, John Lane; New York, John Lange Co. 1907).

   Laumer, Keith. A Trace of Memory. Turns out to be very much Arthurian
   about halfway through. Difficult to say more without spoilers. First
   published as a serial in Amazing Stories in about 1963 and reprinted
   since.

   Lawhead, Stephen, Taliesin, Merlin, Arthur (Avon Books, plus British
   and Australian printings. 1988). Lawhead is an excellent writer and
   these stories make a very good read. Be warned, Arthur gets dragged
   down by a somewhat stridently Christian slant, in a tale that differs
   substantially from the first two books. Pendragon has been just
   released, 1994.

   Lerner, Alan J. and Frederick Lowe. Camelot. 1961.

   Lodge, David. Small World. New York: Warner Communications, 1986.
   First published: 1984. It's Arthurian in the same way as Lyre of
   Orpheus, but deals with Perceval.

   McDermott, Gerald, The Knight of the Lion (New York : Four Winds
   Press, c1979). Juvenile: a retelling of the adventures of Sir Yvain
   and his faithful lion, as the young knight goes through several trials
   to prove himsself worthy of a great triumph.

   McGowen, Tom, Sir Machinery (Folet Publishing Company, Chicago, 1970.
   ISBN 0-695-40167-X hardback, 0-695-80167-8 trade paperback.) An
   amusing children's tale set in modern days. Based upon the notion that
   King Arthur will come back to save Britain again.

   McKenzie, Nancy. The Child Queen. (Del Rey, 1994. ISBN 0-345-38244-7.)
   The sequel, The High Queen is planned. A well written tale from
   Guinevere's point of view. The setting and feel is similar to Mary
   Stewart's, although some details differ. Lancelot is in this version,
   and very well done.

   Marshall, Edison, The Pagan King (Garden City, N.Y., Doubleday, 1959).


   Matthews, John, ed., An Arthurian Reader: Selections from Arthurian
   Legend, Scholarship, and Story (Aquarian Press, Sterling Publishing

   Ballantine Books, c1976). Originally published as 2 separate works:
   King of the World's Edge and The Ship from Atlantis.

   Munn, H. Warner, Merlin's Ring, (New York, Ballantine Books [1974]).

   Newman, Sharan, Guinevere, Guinevere, The Chessboard Queen, and
   Guinevere Evermore, (Bantam, 1981. ISBN: 0-553-20354-1). A haunting
   fairy-tale rendition of Guinevere's childhood, marriage to Arthur, and
   participation in the events of Camelot. GtCQ was released in hardcover
   and then went out of print. Strangely, it does not appear to have been
   available in paper though the other two are currently available in
   trade paperback.

   Norton, Andre [Alice Mary Norton]. Here Abide Monsters. New York:
   Atheneum, 1973.

   Norton, Andre, Merlin's Mirror (Daw Books, 1975.) Merlin is a half-
   breed: human and space alien, and the war between light and darkness
   is recast into a war between two space going races. The premise is
   bizarre, but Norton makes it work well.

   Sampson, Fay, Daughter of Tintagel. Headline Book Publishing, London,

   volumes: Wise Woman's Telling, White Nun's Telling, Black Smith's
   Telling, Taliesin's Telling, Herself. Here's what the book jacket
   reads: The bards have sung this tale the length and breadth of
   Britain. The story of the momentous birth of the legendary Arthur -
   the story of the fear, hate and love between him and his half-sister
   Morgan the Fay. But never before have there been five tellings, each
   by a witness to the mythical events: Gwennol Far-Sight, Morgan's
   childhood nurse and a wise woman in the ways of sacred pagan magic.
   Luned, the young white nun, who fears her own soul has been contamined
   by Morgan's passions. Teilo, who was once a proud and powerful Smith
   of the Old Religion, condemned to live as a woman amongst Morgan's
   maids, because of his unwise ambition. The bard Taliesin, bred to sing
   of war and red slaughter and glorious death. And finally Morgan the
   Fay herself speaks, the Goddess, the witch, whose story has
   shape-shifted down the centuries, a force for destruction or a force
   for healing...?

   Seare, Nicholas, Rude Tales and Glorious (Clarkson N. Potter, Inc.,
   New York, 1983. Hardback). [Out of Print] Classic rendition. Title
   says it all. This is a retelling of the Arthurian tales. Merlin is a
   two bit con artist/pimp, Gwen is a whore that enjoys giving out free
   samples, Arthur is Merlin's assistant. It is a riot. Seare is a pen
   name for a well known author as yet unrevealed. Speculation centers on
   Rodney Whitaker (source William Poundstone, Biggest Secrets).

   Service, Pamela F., Winter of Magic's Return, Tomorrow's Magic
   (Atheneum, New York, 1987). Five hundred years after the Devastation
   destroys modern civilization, the young Merlin and two friends succeed
   in bringing back King Arthur to Britain in the grip of a nuclear
   winter and together they struggle to build a new and better society
   despite the evil plotting of Morgan Le Fay. Juvenile fiction.

   Shwartz, Susan, The Grail of Hearts (New York: Tor Books, 1992, ISBN

   0-933635-70-2. This is part of an excellent role playing game, but the
   books are worth reading by themselves as well. There are several books
   the game is made of, purchaseable separately. Most of it is a very
   detailed glossary of people in the various versions of the saga (with
   primacy to Mallory's), but almost half of it is spent on similar
   glossaries of notable places, of special "things", and many other
   fascinating tidbits, such as an attempt at a self-consistent
   chronology of Arthur's reign, and so on.

   writing, worth reading. Long.

   Treece, Henry, The Great Captains (New York: Random House, 1956.) This
   is another sort of Celtic late Roman novel with characters such as

   the legend from the earliest stories. More comedic than some of the
   other versions. Be warned, The Book of Merlin rehashes many themes and
   stories from TOFK. It's good, but if you experience deja-vu while
   reading it, well, that's why.

   a melancholy interpretation of the theme; Morris' different approach
   apparent in the rich sensuality of his "The Defence of Guenevere."

   character in the dark ages as the meeting place of Saxon and Celt; the
   glory of its Abbey as the center of English and medieval civilization;
   and the significance of its legends in the mystical theory of the Holy
   Grail -- a primary factor in the development of European religious
   thought.

   just through lots of hints, such as the obvious reference through
   "Fisher King" with the Greek connection of the fish for Jesus, as well
   as the "I shall make you fishers of men" phrase in the Gospel, etc -
   but also through meticulously detailed research). Not directly about

   original full name of the comic strip was "Prince Valiant in the Days
   of King Arthur" although the long title is seldom used anymore except
   for books reprinting the original stories. The comic was by Harold
   Foster and started in 1937, it is considered a masterpiece of comics
   by experts and was fairly faithful to Arthurian legend and spirit. It
   still runs today in many Sunday papers, syndicated by King Features,
   under Foster's successor John Cullen Murphy. The strips have been
   reprinted in numerous books and the story has been turned into
   animated and live action movies. The book is a history of the strip
   and its Arthurian stories.

   argue that the core of the Arthurian and Holy Grail traditions do not
   derive from Celtic folklore and mythology, but rather from the
   folklore and mythology of the Alans and the Sarmatians,
   Northeast-Iranian speaking steppe nomads who invaded Europe in the
   final days of the Roman Empire. Although this book contains a complete

Medieval and early texts

   Gawain and the Grene Knight. Many translations, including one by JRR
   Tolkien (Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, Clarendon Press, Oxford,
   1930).

   Lancelot of the Lake. Available in pb from Oxford's "The World's
   Classics" series. Anonymous, Arthurian cycle: Lancelot of the Lake,
   The Quest of the Holy Grail, and The Death of Arthur. Available in
   pb from Penguin. Most later Arthurian texts (especially Mallory) are
   based on these, the same way most texts after Chretien derived from
   Chretien. The first listed, the "short" or "non-cyclic prose
   Lancelot," is a very interesting point in the development of the
   legend: Lancelot is not yet involved in the Grail quest (indeed, it is
   implied that it has already occurred by the time he comes to King
   Arthur's court). The "cycle" is the first (existing) text, or set of
   texts, to unite all the fundamental themes of the mythos. Also
   available from Penguin is a single volume edition with two long poetic
   "morts d'Artu," under the title The Death Of King Arthur. One is in
   rhymed verse, the other in alliterative.

   The Death of King Arthur. Trans. with an Intro. by James Cable.
   London, New York, Victoria, Ontario, Aukland: Penguin Books, 1988.
   (Translation of La Mort le Roi Artu).

   King Arthur's Death: The Middle English Stanzaic Morte Arthur and
   Alliterative Morte Arthure. Ed. Larry D. Benson. Exeter: U of Exeter,
   1986. (There are translations of these)

   The Mabinogion (many translations.) The Mabinogion is the collection
   of Welsh stories and legends, where elements of the Arthurian legend
   can be found. These probably form the basis for the legend as we have
   it today, though scholars seem to revise their opinions every now and
   then.

   Blackmore, Sir Richard, An Heroick Poem (London, printed for Awnsham
   and John Churchil, 1695). In ten books. Probably out of print.

   Chretien de Troyes, Arthurian Romances (Everyman's Library #698).
   Various translations. He was a 12th century writer/poet and the single
   most improtant influence on the development of the Arthurian mythos:
   it was he who linked Lancelot to Guinevere and who introduced the
   moral question of their affair (in Lancelot, Or the Knight of the
   Cart) and it was quite possibly he who brought the story of the Grail
   Quest to Arthur's court (in Perceval).

   Chretien de Troyes, Ywain, the Knight of the Lion (Translated by
   Robert W. Ackermand and Frederick W. Lock, Unger, New York, 1957, plus
   other translations).

   Chretien de Troyes, Perceval, The Story of the Grail. (English
   translation by Nigel Bryant, ISBN: 0-85991-224-8). The story of the
   making of a knight in both worldly and spiritual terms, and the source
   of some of the most dramatic and mysterious adventures of romance.

   Le Clerc, Guillaume. Fergus of Galloway: Knight of Arthur. (Trans.
   with an Intro, and notes by D.D.R. Owen. Rutlan: Charles E. Tuttle,
   1991)

   Malory, Sir Thomas, Le Morte D'Arthur (many editions). The classic
   15th century rendition of Arthurian legend according the French
   tradition. About where Lancelot in his romantic, very French, form was
   added, and where the search for the Grail was put in Christian terms.
   Notes: Caxton (1422-1491) edited Morte D'Arthur and changed it quite a
   bit in so doing. The original (non-edited-by-Caxton) version is
   available from Oxford University Press under the title Malory: Works
   (1973). In this edition, there are a number of loosely connected
   stories: Caxton conflated some, elided others, and bound the whole
   thing together under one theme: Arthur's tragedy. Furthermore, there
   are various non-Malory versions of the Morte Arthure and Le Morte
   Arthur c.1400 and c.1350 respectively. These were a part of the
   impetus behind Malory's later version.

Periodicals

   John, Christopher. Rev. of Excalibur. Ares July, 1981, 21.

   John, Christoper, Rev. of Knightriders. Ares July, 1981,

   Lambides, Freya Reeves, pub., Avalon to Camelot (Debra N. Mancoff,
   ed.) A quarterly journal started in Fall 1983, lasted for four regular
   issues to Summer 1984 before the publisher folded. Two more issues
   came out, but are not generally available. It had some excellent
   articles, and was well illustrated for a non-color production.
   Surviving copies may be collector's items.

Arthurian references (fictional)

   Barr, Mike and Brian Bolland. Camelot 3000, 1981, DC Comics. 12 issue
   limited series later bound into a trade paperback. Rides the fine
   lines between clever and stupid, inspired and tacky. Futuristic story
   about a reincarnated (and ethnically mixed) Round Table, aliens, etc.

   Cherryh, C.J., Port Eternity (DAW Books, New York, c1982). Science
   fiction novel with arthurian elements and references.

   Coney, Michael Greatrex, Fang, the Gnome. (Signet/New American
   Library, ISBN 0-451-15847-4). The main characters are Fang, Nyneve,
   Avalona (the non-human who teaches Nyneve) and Merlin (Avalona's son).
   Arthurian characters who appear: Tristam and Iseult, Arthur, and
   Galahad - with the other characters appearing only in "the Game"
   played by Nyneve, Avalona and Merlin. The Game is used to enter an
   alternate reality and influence the characters there. Eventually the
   other reality merges with that of Earth and the Arthurian story
   becomes a reality.

   Coney, Michael Greatrex. King of the Scepter'd Isle. New York, London,
   Victoria, Ontario, Auckland: Penguin Books, 1990 (Previously published
   in hardcover by NAL Books, no date given). The sequel to Fang the
   Gnome.

   Cooper, Susan, Over Sea, Under Stone, The Dark Is Rising, The Green
   Witch, The Grey King, Silver on the Tree. Celtic derived fantasy,
   some references to Arthur. While these are "juveniles" they present
   good reading for adults as well.

   Crow, Donna Fletcher. Glastonbury: The Novel of Christian England.
   Wheaton: Good News, 1992. Has only 100 pages or so on Arthur's time.
   Seems to be like Sarum - spanning the ages.

   Davies, Robertson, The Lyre of Orpheus.

   Drake, David, The Dragon Lord, (Berkeley Pub. Group, 1979. ISBN
   0-399-12380-6). This is about an Irish soldier fighting in Arthur's
   army. All the usual characters are there, fairly prominently, but they
   are not the protagonists.

   Kay, Guy Gavriel, The Summer Tree, The Wandering Fire and The Darkest
   Road. Also known collectively as "The Fionavar Tapestry." Arthur,
   Lancelot and Guinevere are, in various forms, called back to assist in
   defeating The Unraveller in the one True World, Fionavar. In addition,
   the tale is steeped in Celtic mythology and part of the fun is
   matching characters back to specific myths and legends.

   Knowles, Sir James, The Legends of King Arthur and his Knights,
   (London, New York: Warne and Co., 1895).

   Laubenthal, Sanders Anne. Excalibur (Ballantine Books, 1973 ISBN
   0-345- 25635-23-195). Present day fiction concerning the current
   Pendragon, a Welsh archaelogist, searching for Excalibur in Mobile,
   Alabama (where legend says Prince Madoc of Wales hid it after Arthur's
   final defeat) while another takes a Grail quest at the same time.
   Morgan and Morgause oppose them. There is a strong Celtic flavor to
   the conflict. Out of print.

   Lewis, C.S., That Hideous Strength (part of a three book set). While
   it does have much non-Arthurian material, it does deal a good bit with
   the line of the Pendragons and one of the characters is the awakened
   Merlinus Ambrosius.

   Saberhagen, Fred. Dominion. Dracula and Merlin have a longstanding
   feud that threatens to undermine their resistance to the real source
   of trouble -- Nimue. Set in modern day, this book is readable if a bit
   ambiguous.

   Spenser, Edmund, The Faerie Queene. An excellent work and is Arthurian
   at least in some of its sections, and should be comprehensible to
   anyone who can read Malory.

   Vance, Jack, Suldrun's Garden, The Green Pearl, Madouc (New York :
   Berkeley Publishing Group, c1983/c1985/c1989). Collectively known as
   the Lyonesse, and the first book is sometimes titled Lyonesse. These
   books are written so as to involve themselves in the origin of the
   round table and one or two of the knights found in Arthurian legend.

   Walton, Evangeline, Prince of Annwn, The Children of Llyr, The Song of
   Rhiannon and The Island of the Mighty (Del Rey, 1970). Modern
   reworkings of The Mabinogion. Excellently written. May be hard to
   find. Recently reissued in large tradeback.

   Wagner, Matt. Mage: The Hero Discovered, 1984. Comico Comics. 15 issue
   mini-series reprinted into 5 MageBooks. Return of Arthur to present
   day. Good story, good artwork. Part one of a projected Trilogy. Wagner
   has delayed finishing the other two, tentatively titled The Hero
   Defined and The Hero Denied, but rumors talk of a 1995 release.

   Wein, Elizabeth. The Winter Prince (Atheneum, 1992). A young adult
   novel, told from the point of view of Mordraut (Mordred) about his
   love-hate relationship with his father Artos and his half-brother and
   sister.

   Zelazny, Roger. The Last Defender of Camelot. Anthology. Avon, 1988.
   ISBN 0-380-70316-5. Only the title story involves Lancelot and the
   Holy Grail; the rest of the book is science fiction.

Celtic fiction

   Alexander, Lloyd, The Book of Three, The Black Cauldron, Castle of
   Llyr, Taran Wanderer, The High King. Based on Celtic mythology, these
   are excellent "children's" books.
