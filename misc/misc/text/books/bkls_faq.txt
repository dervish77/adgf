                    BOOK CATALOGUES AND BOOK CLUBS LIST

   The most recently posted version of this list may be obtained by
   anonymous ftp to rtfm.mit.edu under

     /pub/usenet/news.answers/books/catalogues.

   Or, send email to mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu with send
   usenet/news.answers/books/catalogues in the body of the message,
   leaving the subject line empty.

   I welcome all corrections, additions, etc. When sending me information
   for a new inclusion, PLEASE use the entries below to guide you in
   determining what information I need and what to include in the
   paragraph summary. Information submitted like this will be entered
   faster than simply mailing me catalogues and/or reams of information
   and letting me do the work.

   I will take contributions from both private parties and from the
   companies themselves. Extremely specialized topics are fine. I prefer
   catalogues that inventory at least 90% books, please don't send me
   information about catalogues that contain only the occasional book.
   Thank you!

   I make no guarantees as to the correctness of each entry. If you spot
   anything that needs correcting, let me know and I will update.

   Phone numbers are supplied "as is." Especially when phoning to another
   country, you will have to verify the proper prefix codes that you must
   dial.

   My thanks to the many people who have contributed information to this
   archive. The list has grown beyond my ability to list all of them,
   but your contributions remain appreciated, and necessary for the
   success of this list.

       Postal book service, specialising in second-hand works on all
       aspects of sexuality. Catalogues on various subjects issued on a
       fairly regular basis. Of particular interest are the "Special" and
       "Vintage Paperback" catalogues. The first lists uncommon items of
       erotica and related material of a bibliographical and historical
       character. The "Vintage Paperback" catalogues are extensive,
       seldom less than 1,000 items, and include erotic literature
       published by Brandon House, the Olympia Press (Paris and New
       York), Collector's Publications, Greenleaf Classics, etc. The
       entries in both catalogues are often accompanied by useful
       bibliographical notes incorporating information not easily found
       elsewhere. The real names of pseudonymous authors are given, where
       known by the compiler. Due to the size of the "Vintage Paperback"
       catalogue, there is a charge for a copy. However, the catalogues
       are handy reference works in themselves, and worth the price on
       that account, and their cost is deducted from the bill of any
       books you buy.

Book Clubs

   Note that many book clubs are actually operated by the same company.
   In this case, the company is listed with its satellite clubs. The
   lists are not complete, so if you notice gaps, addresses and
   corrections are welcomed. I know for example that Doubleday BC,
   Literary Guild and SFBC are all under the same company, but I don't
   know the company name.

   A tip regarding the book clubs that require you to send back a "no"
   notification for the current selection (also known as "negative
   response"): you can save yourself some postage and hassles by
   informing them that you travel a lot or have an irregular schedule and
   to switch your status to a positive response (mail the card in only
   when you want a book). Most clubs will do this.

   BSBISY = "buy several books in several years".

   Most clubs have some sort of bonus plan: free books or substantial
   price reductions after the purchase of so many books. There are
   usually substantial savings when joining the club: several books for a
   dollar, for example.

     * Book Of the Month Club, Inc.

       Camp Hill, PA 17012-0001

       A number of clubs under this corporation's auspices:

            BSBISY club. Good quality books. They also publish their own
            anthologies and collections. Variety of books. Earn points
            with each book purchased, any book available for a certain
            number of points. Regular club prices are about 20% less than
            published prices.

          + History Book Club

            BSBISY club. Good quality books. A variety of history:
            military history, social history, etc. Mostly American and
            European history, though there are books available on a wide
            number of countries. After every fourth book purchased, you
            get a bonus certificate, allowing you to buy any book listed
            for about half price. Regular club prices are approximately
            20% less than published prices.

          + Quality Paperback Book Club [US]

            Tel: 800-233-1066 {US}

            This club prints paperback versions of many hardbacks. Good
            prices, reasonable quality. Excellent savings possible. You

            with the number of points it takes to get it for free.
            Joining requires that you receive their mailings for a year.
            Normally negative-response. The club offers a free search
            service for their items: you can call them and they can tell
            you if they have a particular title.

       Schlessinger's book titled "the unraveling of America," or
       something like that). Prices aren't that great, usually (15-25%

     * Newbridge Book Clubs

       Deran, NJ (better address?)

       Unlike most book clubs, the Newbridge Book Clubs issue editions
       which are identical to the publisher's editions. Several book
       clubs (all of which use the same address above unless otherwise
       noted)are under Newbridge auspices, these include

          + Library of Computer and Information Sciences, A Newbridge
            Book Club

            PO Box 6009
            Delran, NJ 08370-6009
            Tel: 800-336-9980

            Although the selection is mixed, a few gems appear from time-
            to-time to make it worthwhile. Although it's a "negative
            response" club, the time period between receipt of the reply
            card and the shipment of the book is very generous, much more
            than the advertised 10 days. Also, once your initial purchase
            obligation has been completed, you can easily call them and
            be switched to "positive response" status.

          + Natural History Book Club

       year. There is a possibility of group-memberships. Ask for details
       directly. The club is a mainly a publisher in itself which edits
       literature in sciences, social sciences and humanities, but offers
       some books by other companies as well. As book-prices are fixed in
       Germany there is not always a possibility of economies when
       purchasing books by other publishers. The books of the club itself
       are cheaper than in the book store. The club/publishing house is
       most famous for a series called "Wege der Forschung" (paths of
       research), which re-prints important articles and chapters of
       books from the history of the research into a specific subject
       (covering sciences, social sciences, humanities). BUT EVERYTHING
       IN GERMAN, with the exception that in the mentioned series some
       numbers have parts in original and some do translate them. There
       are other series as well including editions of classical texts,
       over- views of and introductions into special fields of research.
       The club additionally offers a selection of arts and artisan
       works, the latter often remakes of historical artisan work e.g.
       keltish etc. These are offered in an extra catalogue. (From member
