Welcome to Book List #18: The "Red Zone" Catalog.  
  
We are in the Red Zone!  In football, the "red zone" is the last twenty  
yards before the ultimate goal of the end zone.  In this case, it refers to  
the last four weeks before the nominal due date of our baby.  Of course  
as I understand it, the event could now happen at any time.  You will  
have to forgive me if my responses to your orders and contacts are  
slow or just plain incoherent in coming weeks.  It's not enough that I  
just entered the Red Zone.  I've also just left the Twilight Zone!  At  
least, that's what it seems like with the Seattle Mariners winning the  
American League West and dramatically defeating the New York  
Yankees before losing to Cleveland in the American League  
championship.  The city was delirious.  I felt like it was all a dream.   
I've always been more an enthusiast of the NCAA basketball  
tournament than professional sports, but the Miracle Mariners was  
enough to make me, and even my wife who doesn't have a competitive  
bone in her body, sit glued to the tv set cheering every Mariner hit.   
Even now the season is over, but the memories linger.  
  
There's some great new items in this catalog.  You knew I was going  
to say that, didn't you?  Well, it's the truth, even if I say so myself.   
There's a simply wonderful copy of  Robert Bloch's Psycho.  I'm going  
to regret seeing it go.  Similarly, I'm offering a lovely copy of The Man  
Who Japed by Philip K. Dick.  There are several signed, limited  
editions by authors including Asimov, Lansdale, Lee, Blaylock,  
Donaldson, King, Rice and others.  For you humor fans (like me) I've  
got Tom Holt's latest, Djinn Rummy.  There are award winners by  
Brunner, Bujold, Delany, Farmer and others.  I'm telling y'all, this  
whole catalog is a winner!  Remember now, Christmas is just around  
the corner.  What better than to treat yourself (if you can't convince  
that significant other to do the treating) to a fine book (or three) from  
Tall Tales?  You deserve it!
