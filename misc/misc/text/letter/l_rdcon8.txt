Greetings,


     I am writing to check on the status of my membership for Readercon 8. 

I submitted my registration back in November, 1995.  Though I did receive

a progress report via the mail, it did not indicate my membership status.

The mailing label did not say "Pre-paid member" on it, as stated in the 

report.  Please let me know whether you have me listed as a member or not.

Thank you for time and attention.



						Sincerely,




						Brian Lingard
