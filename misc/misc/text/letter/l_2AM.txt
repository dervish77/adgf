Dear Ms. Anderson,


	I received your postcard concerning my request for a current issue

of 2AM magazine.  If it is not too late, I would like to take you up on

your offer of two back issues in place of a current issue.  I am mainly

interested in getting at least one copy to preview the kind of fiction

you publish.  If a current issue is ready, that would be just fine.

	Thank you for your time and your generous offer.




					Sincerely,





					Brian Lingard
