To Whom It May Concern,


    I am writing regarding a situation that has developed involving the renewel process 

for the fourth season of a Warner Bros. television show called "Babylon 5."  It is 

currently being shown in the Boston area on WBSK.  The problem is that WSBK has stated

publicly that if the show did not improve its ratings during the month of May, it was

unlikely that they would renew it.  Though the show has a great following in the Boston 

area, its ratings numbers would indicate otherwise.  The biggest problem contributing to 

its poor ratings performance is WBSK's choice of time slot (10:30 PM on Sunday's).  Also 

for most of the months of February and March WSBK kept moving the show's time slot 

around without warning to allow room for sports programming.

    I would like to urge WLVI56 to pick up Babylon 5 if WSBK fails to renew the show.  

I am an avid fan of the show and have many friends that are also avid fans.  As a Warner 

Bros. affiliate, Babylon 5 would make a great addition to WLVI56's already great lineup 

of science fiction/fantasy shows such as Star Trek Deep Space Nine, Hercules, and Xena.

    Thank you for your time and consideration of this situation.



							Sincerely,
