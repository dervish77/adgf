Dear Mr. Abner,


    Some time ago I purchased several back issues, and I must say what
 
a great magazine!  An outlet for horror fiction such as yours has been

long overdue.

    I have greatly enjoyed the works by Tom Piccirilli, Donald Burleson,

and J. N. Williamson, to name a few.  In the future, I would especially

like to see more by Burleson and also new stuff from Nina Kiriki Hoffmann.  

Much of the 'first sale fiction' is also of high quality and has spurred me 

on with new ideas in my own writing.  Speaking of which, please send a copy 

of any fiction guidelines in the enclosed SASE.

   As per issue your request for feedback in the most recent issue, I would

like to see both a letters column and some occasional interior art.  I don't

think it's necessary that the art have anything to do with a given story.

I personally just enjoy seeing the demented images. 

   Lastly, please find an enclosed check for $18.00 for a 4 issue subscription

which I would like to begin with issue #12.  Please use the above noted 

mailing address.  Thanks for a great horror magazine!!




					Sincerely,
