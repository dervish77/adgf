Dear Mr. Ambrose,


    Some time ago I purchased all available back issues and I have 

been quite impressed with your magazine.  It has a good mix of fiction,

poetry, and science-fact articles.  I was particularly impressed by the

work of Albert J. Manachino.  Also the "Alien Skyscape" series of articles

by William A. Ambrose stirred my imagination and has encouraged me

to dream up some of my own tales.


    Please find an enclosed check for $14.00 for a 4 issue subscription

and please begin the subscription with issue #21.  I am not concerned 

that this may not be the most current issue.  Once again, thanks for 

a great little magazine!




					Sincerely,





					Brian Lingard
