Dear Mr. Robertson,


    I am writing to you regarding a seriously deteriorating situation with the 

broadcasting of the Warner Bros. show "Babylon 5" here in the Boston, Mass. area.  The 

local affiliate WSBK has on three out of four showings cut to commercials during the 

middle of acts and also cut to commercials twenty to thirty seconds early.  On one 

occasion they failed to broadcast a new episode due to a technical problem with the 

tape, but did not warn viewers about the problem and simply re-broadcast the previous 

week's episode.

    Though the show has a great following in the Boston area, the ratings numbers would 

indicate otherwise.   These low numbers are more than likely due to WSBK failing to 

promote the show and moving it to a poor time slot (10:30 PM).  Thus new viewers are apt 

to never notice the show.  I would ask that action be taken to urge WSBK to treat the

show with proper respect and to renew the show for a fourth season, or that a new home 

for the show would be found at another Boston area affiliate (for example WLVI56).  I am 

a big fan of the show and would definitely be upset if the show is not renewed for a 

fourth season due to WSBK's problems.  

    Thank you for your time and consideration of this situation. 



							Sincerely,




							Brian S. Lingard
