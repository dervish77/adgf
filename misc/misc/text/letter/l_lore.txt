Dear Mr. Heather,


	Congratulations on two great first issues of your magazine.  I read 

each issue with great interest.  I especially like the stories by Harlan

Ellison and Brian McNaughton in the first issue.  The second issue also 

featured some solid fiction.  The artwork in both issues was also superb.

	Please begin a four-issue subscription with issue #3, and please 

find an enclosed check for $15.00.

	I would also like to receive a copy of your fiction submission

guidelines.  I have enclosed a #10 SASE for your convenience.

	Once again, thanks for a great new small press publication!




					Sincerely,





					Brian Lingard
