Welcome to LIBGFS version 0.9 (beta) --- released 29 Jan 1996
____________________________________________________________


LIBGFS is a GUI library package developed using SRGP as the underlying
graphics library.  SRGP itself is a simple raster graphics package
built on top of X-windows.  SRGP is commonly used in graphics courses
as a tool for learning basic graphics concepts.

LIBGFS was developed as an experiment to understand how modern GUI's 
perform such operations as gadget creation and management.  It is
certainly not intended to be used for real application development.
Hopefully, LIBGFS could serve as a starting place for others who wish
to learn about GUI design and for those who would like to experiment
with creating their own gadget types.

Currently supported features include:

	- Push Button Gadget
	- Toggle Button Gadget
	- Menu Bar Gadget
	- Sub Menu Gadget (i.e. Pulldown Menu)
	- Drawing Area Gadget
	- Text Gadget

	- gadget placement is "bulletin board" type
	- 


Features under development:

	- gadget placement using forms
	- dialog boxes

Building LIBGFS:

First off, you must have the SRGP distribution installed and built.  The 
SRGP package is available via anonymous ftp from:

	ftp://wilma.cs.brown.edu/pub	- 	srgp.tar.Z

If all else fails, send e-mail to 'graphtext@cs.brown.edu' with a subject
line of "Software-Distribution" to receive more information.

After you have SRGP installed and have SRGP built, you will probably need 
to modify the the file 'libgs_defs' to point to where the includes and 
libraries are for both SRGP and the LIBGFS packages.


To unpack distribution type:

	gunzip libgfs.tar.gz
	tar xvf libgfs.tar


To make everything type:

	cd libgfs
	make


To run the test program type:

	cd libgfs/test
	test


To install edit the top level Makefile, for variables INSTALL_LIB_PATH
and INSTALL_INCLUDE_PATH, then type:

	cd libgfs
	make install


To uninstall type:

	cd libgfs
	make uninstall
