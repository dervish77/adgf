3D renderer -- for polygon based model files

This directory contains the source code for a 3D rendering program.  This
program currently supports orthographic, parallel and perspective viewing.
The program also supports wireframe, outline, and colored shading types 
of rendering.  The color shading scheme currently uses flat shaded polygons.
This directory contains the files:

	render.c	- main program
	rendutls.h	- high level rendering functions
	clipping.h	- clipping functions
	shading.h	- shading functions
	sorting.h	- polygon sort functions
	drawutls.h	- screen drawing functions using SRGP
	mathutls.h	- math related functions
	data		- sample polygon data file
	view		- sample view description file
	makefile	- makefile for above
