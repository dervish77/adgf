<tr bgcolor=#f0f0f0><td><a href="index.html#refoperation137371" target = "projectFrame"><b>heapTest</b></a></td><td>operation</td><td> The heapTest method creates two arrays of objects on the heap.  As each <br /> object is created, some data within the object is initialized.  Then <br /> nearly all the objects in each array are deleted, one object in one array, <br /> and two objects in the other array are left intact, hence creating a direct <br /> memory leak.<br /><br /> Also another object is created that contains a method called doLeak.  This <br /> method is called before deleting the object which results in an indirect <br /> memory leak when the object itself is deleted.<br /> </td></tr>
