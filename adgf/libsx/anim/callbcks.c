/*  -- CALLBACK ROUTINES  --
 *
 * These functions are called when various things happen in your windows.
 * They should handle what happened and give feedback to the user.  Most
 * likely they will set options in your program (which is what the 
 * MyProgram data structure is for), and cause different things to happen, 
 * like loading and saving files, etc.
 *
 * Remember, the last argument to your callback is always a void pointer
 * to whatever data you specified when you created the widget.  You
 * must cast the pointer to be whatever type it really is.

/*
 * The following function is called when keypresses happen in the drawing
 * area widget.
 *
 *  It is useful to know that the string returned to your program is
 * not necessarily a single ASCII character. You will get the usual
 * ASCII characters, including control characters (such as ^C or ^H).
 * But, the workstation's function keys will also be returned in a
 * string such as "F11" or "F23".  You will also get other longer
 * strings such as "Control_L", "Alt_R", or "Shift_L".  It is
 * important to understand that even if you just press the shift key to
 * get a capital letter, you will first receive the string "Shift_L"
 * or "Shift_R", then you will receive a capital letter (say, "H").
 * You should probably ignore the "Shift_L" or "Shift_R" messages (but
 * who knows, you may find some use for them).
 *
 * The argument, up_or_down, tells you whether the given key was pressed 
 * or released.  If the key was pressed down, up_or_down has a zero (0),
 * if the key was released, up_or_down contains a 1.
 *
 * NOTE WELL:
 *   The string that is returned to you can _NOT_ (I'll repeat that,
 *   can _NOT_) be modified by your program.  Got it?  Do _NOT_ modify
 *   the string.  If you want to munge with it, make a copy using
 *   strdup() or strcpy() into your own buffer space.
