README for Animation Demo for Articulated Structures			4/21/95
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This directory contains some demo software for a simple demo of animating
an articulated structure consisting of a single chain of links.  This
software utilizes the simple X library known as LIBSX.  You must have the
library file 'libsx.a' compiled/installed on your target system.  See the
notes below for information on obtaining LIBSX.  

The articulated structure itself is defined by an input file with the format 
as shown below.  The user interface is briefly described below.  Currently this
software only supports single chains with no branches, supports only a rotation
about the 'z' axis (using right handed coordinates).  The actual animation 
produced uses forward kinematic techniques of either reading a new state 
vector from a table or generating a randomized delta state vector.  The state
vector table is limited to 20 frames per cycle, and currently only supports 
4 links in the chain (sorry).


User interface:
	File menu
	   Open...		- opens and loads input file
	   About...		- about message popup
	   Help...		- brief online help
	   Quit			- quit program

	Anim Mode menu
	   Manual		- not supported
	   Linear		- not supported
	   Circle		- not supported
	   Random		- not supported
	   Forward Table	- forward kinematics using state vector table
	   Forward Random	- forward kinematics using random state vector

	Run button		- run animation

	Stop button		- stop animation

	Scroll bar		- change desired frame rate


Input file format:
	num_links
	type_link ox oy oz tl vl rx ry rz 
	end_type 
	motion_type
	num_frames_per_cycle
	l1_zrot ... ln_zrot

    where
	num_links	- total number of links in hierarchy (int)
	type_link	- 4 character keyword (root, link, or brch)
	ox, oy, oz	- origin of link (only valid if root) (float triplet)
	tl		- total length of link (float)
	vl		- visible length of link (float)
	rx, ry, rz	- rotation about each axis (float degrees)
	end_type	- 6 character keyword (square, circle, or triang)
	motion_type	- 6 character keyword (manual, linear, circle, or random)
	num_frames	- number of frames per animation cycle (0 = no table)
	ln_zrot		- z axis rotation for nth link (one value per link)

Notes: Obtaining LIBSX

Libsx can be obtaining via anonymous ftp from "ftp.funet.fi" at 
the path:

	

Libsx has been successfully compiled on most workstations supporting 
the Athena widget set.
