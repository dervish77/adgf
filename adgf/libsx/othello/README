README for libsx version of Othello
____________________________________________________________________________


This is an experiment in writing a game which performs simple processing
of game rule logic, and the associated 2D graphics required for drawing
the game board and player pieces.

Making and installing:

	Unpack by -> gunzip othello.tar.gz
	          -> tar xvf othello.tar

	Make by   -> cd othello
	          -> make all

	This will build the game executable and install it into your 
	'$HOME/bin' directory.  If you prefer to install the game somewhere 
	else, edit the makefile to set the INSTALL_DIR variable to your 
	desired location.

	CAUTION:  READ the notes at the end of this file before attempting
		  to build the executable.

	This program has been successfully compiled on Sun workstations 
	(Solaris 5.3) and SGI workstations (Irix 6.2 and 6.3).

Background and Rules:

Othello is played on a rectangular grid of squares usually about 16 
by 16.  There are two colors for player pieces -- black and white.
The game starts with two pieces of each color placed in the center of
the board as follows:

				  W B
				  B W

The white player gets the first move and can place his piece in any
position indicated by the 'x' as shown below:

				    x
				  W B x
				x B W
				  x

When the white player makes his move, all the black pieces between the newly
placed piece and an existing white piece flip over to the white color, for
example:

				  W W W
				  B W

The black player can make his move similarly into any of the positions
marked with an 'x' as shown below:

				  x   x
				  W W W
				  B W x

And similarly, when black moves the previously white pieces flip over 
to black as thus:

				      B
				  W B W
				  B W 

And so on, until all empty board positions are filled.  The player with
the most pieces on the board wins.

As a point of stategy, securing a corner location on the board can make 
or break a player's chance of winning.  A player should endeavor to 
secure a corner as early as possible.

For this version of the game, Player 1 is White, while Player 2 is Black,
and Player 1 always goes first.

Playing the Game:

You may play the game in either single player or two player mode.  Single
player mode pits you against the computer.  Two player mode allows two people 
to play.  There is also a demo mode which has the computer take over
playing both sides.

When playing the computer, you can select several different skill levels,
including no skill, random moves, corners, max flips, and AI.  The no skill
level mode has the computer simply take the first legal move it finds.  
Random skill mode has the computer build a list of several moves and then
randomly picks one.  Corner skill mode has the computer build a list of 
moves and then pick the move which is closest to a corner.  Max flips mode
has the computer build a list of moves and then take the move which results
in the largest number of flipped pieces.  AI skill level mode has the 
computer combine the corners mode and max flips mode according to a set
of rules which results in the computer making a decision about which move
is best.

If a player finds that no legal move is available, they may press the 
"Pass" button to skip their turn.  Also a player can get see a hint about
any legal moves that may be available by pressing the "Hint" button.

Games in progress can be saved to a file.  These saved games can be 
resumed by loading in a saved game.

Notes:
	
	This program requires that you must have "libsx" installed on
	your system.  Libsx is the simple X library which uses the 
	Athena widget set and provides a easy way to create GUI's for
	applications.

	Libsx can be obtaining via anonymous ftp from "ftp.x.org" at
	the path:

		ftp.x.org:/contrib/libraries/libsx.tar.Z

	Libsx has been successfully compiled on most workstations 
	supporting the Athena widget set.
