			Story Board Master v1.0
			-----------------------

1.0 Introduction

   Story Board Master (SBM) is a tool for creating story boards for the 
serious or casual home animator (and videographer).  Many times the task 
of planning an animation project which spans several hundred frames
or several minutes can be daunting.  The use of story boards has been an 
accepted planning tool within professional circles for many years.  Most 
home animators tend to either "wing it" or sketch out simple story boards
on plain paper.  SBM addresses the needs of these users by providing a desktop
application for creating and maintaining story boards during the production
of an animation project.  The task of coordinating sound effects and dialog
with animation can prove challenging.  There are many tools available to
help in the actual production of the animation, but little to date has been
available for use during the planning stages of a production.  Some animators
have turned to using word processors to create templates for story boards.
Such techniques are fine for very small projects, but when a project involves 
say about 5 minutes worth of animation combined with 10 minutes of live
action video, the planning needs are much greater to successfully complete
the project.


2.0 Features

1)  Paint program style of drawing (bitmap oriented)

2)  Small toolbox of drawing tools:  lines, free hand drawing, rectangles,
	circles, arcs, and import of simple bitmaps.

3)  Variable sized and shaped brushes.

4)  Limited color, black drawing on white foreground.

5)  Limited editing, cut, copy and paste, with one level of undo.

6)  Hierarchical database featuring multiple acts per project, multiple
	scenes per act, and multiple "frames" per scene.  A frame is simply
	the lowest resolution of action which can be expressed, but may in
	fact encompass many animation frames.

7)  Frame drawing area size adjustable from a minimum of 50 x 50 pixels to 
	640 x 400 pixels.

8)  Number of frames visible on screen also variable, from 1 to 20.

9)  View frames as a slide show, both forward and reverse.

10) Each frame can have several lines of text description for action, dialog,
	and sound effect notes.  Each frame can have a separate set of 
	director's notes associated with it.

11) Support for preference printer or output to postscript file.  Print
	format also fully selectable.

12) Support up to 256 acts per project, 256 scenes per act, 256 frames per
	scene, though actual number of frames is limited by available memory.

13) Demo version: all features are the same except saving and printing 
	are disabled.

4.0 Design Notes

Preliminary format of frame (on screen and in print):

	 ---------------------------------------
	|  Act 1        Scene 2        Frame 5  |
	 ---------------------------------------
	|					|
	|					|
	|					|
	|      {drawing area N x M pixels}	|
	|					|
	|					|
	|					|
	 ---------------------------------------
	| A: some action related text here	|
	 ---------------------------------------
	| D: some dialog related text here	|
	 ---------------------------------------
	| S: some sound fx related text here	|
	 ---------------------------------------


Hierarchical project database:

                                  project
                                   /   \
                                  /     \
One or more acts               Act1     Act2
per project                   / | \     / | \
                             /  |  \   /  |  \
One or more scenes         S1  S2  S3 S1  S2  S3
per act                    /\                 /\
                          /  \ {more frames} /  \
                         /    \             /    \
One or more frames      F1    F2           F1    F2
per scene                                   ^
                                            |
                                            |
Thus this position would denoted as {Act2, Scene3, Frame1}
