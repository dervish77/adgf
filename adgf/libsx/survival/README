Notes:
	
	This program requires that you must have "libsx" installed on
	your system.  Libsx is the simple X library which uses the 
	Athena widget set and provides a easy way to create GUI's for
	applications.

	Libsx can be obtaining via anonymous ftp from "ftp.x.org" at
	the path:

		ftp.x.org:/contrib/libraries/libsx.tar.Z

	Libsx has been successfully compiled on most workstations 
	supporting the Athena widget set.
