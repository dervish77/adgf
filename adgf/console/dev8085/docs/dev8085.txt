			User Manual for Dev8085
			_______________________


1.  Introduction

    Dev8085 is a development package for the Intel 8085 8-bit microprocessor.  This package 
features an 8085 cross assembler, a binary dump utility, eprom utilities, module linker, and 
a basic 8085 emulator (text based).

1.1 Building the Package

Unpack the distribution file and build as follows:

	tar xzvf dev8085-0.1.tar.gz
	cd dev8085
	make

1.2 Testing the Tools

Run the regression tests on the newly built tools as follows:

	cd dev8085/test
	../bin/asm85 test1.s85 -r test1.raw
	test test1.raw


2.  Development Tools

2.1 asm85
  
The 'asm5' tool is the 8085 cross assembler.  See "docs/mneumonics.txt" for a list of assembly 
language instructions that the assembler supports

Assemble into raw format as follows:

    asm85 -r file.raw file.s85 

Assemble into binary object module format as follows:

    asm85 -o file.obj file.s85 


2.2 dump85

The 'dump85' tool is the binary dump utility.


2.3 emu85

The 'emu85' tool is a text based 8085 emulator.

Execute a linked executable binary using a specified entry point address as follows:

    emu85 -e 0x1000 file.bin


2.4 link85

The 'link85' tool is the 8085 object module linker.

Link binary object modules into an executable binary as follows:

    link85 -b file.bin file.obj
or
    link85 -b file.bin file1.obj file2.obj file3.obj

Note that one of your binary object modules must contain the entry point of your program.


2.5 srec85

The 'srec85' tool is a utility for converting a binary image into an srecord file for 
programming into a flash or eeprom.
