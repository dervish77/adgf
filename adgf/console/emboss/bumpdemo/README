This directory contains some code for a bump mapping demo.  This
code is based upon some code found in Graphics Gems IV called
"emboss.c".  Listed below are the contents of this directory:

bumpdemo.c	- bump mapping demo program

imagfile.c	- functions used in reading and writing BMP files

imagfile.h	- image file structure for above

emboss.c	- Graphics Gem IV source code

embdemo.c	- modified gems code for simple demo

testimag.c	- test program

makefile	- makefile for all of above

bumpmap.html	- Web page summary of bump mapping

image1.gif	- simple bump mapped image

image2.gif	- bump mapped texture image

bumpfun.bmp	- some text to use a bump map

texture.bmp	- a sample texture image


NOTE:

to make and run the bump map demo, type the following:

	make bumpdemo

	bumpdemo -b bumpfun.bmp -o out1.bmp

	bumpdemo -b bumpfun.bmp -t texture.bmp -o out2.bmp

Image out1.bmp will be just embosed text, and image out2.bmp will be
similar but have the text embossed on a texture image.

You may need to use 'convert' to create '.gif' files out of these
to make them viewable with 'xv'.



Enjoy!!
