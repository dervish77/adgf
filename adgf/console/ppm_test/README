README for ppm_test programs
----------------------------

This directory contains some files useful for reading and writing PPM
formatted image files.  PPM is a simple RGB format and does not include
any support for compression or color map tables.  A PPM file must have 
as the first two characters 'P' and '6'.

For more information on the format see the file "ppm.note".


------------------------------------------------------------------------------


The following is a listing of files contained in this directory:


ppm_note.txt	- reference notes on PPM file format

input.ppm	- sample input file for ppm_test
output.ppm	- example output file produced by ppm_test

makefile	- makefile for ppm_test

ppm.h		- header file for ppm.c
ppm.c		- code for reader and writer functions

ppm_test.c	- test program for reading, writing, and generating PPM files

ppm_test.log	- example output log from ppm_test

 *	Usage:
 *	  ppm_test rf gf pf wf [rsize] [csize]
 *
 *	  rf - read flag, 0 = no read, 1 = read
 *	  gf - gen flag, 0 = no gen, 1 to 11 = gen pattern
 *	  pf - print flag, 0 = no print, 1 = print to screen, 2 = print to log
 *	  wf - write flag, 0 = no write, 1 = write
 *


 *	Examples:
 *
 *	  ppm_test 0 3 0 1 200 200      - would generate a 200x200 checkerboard
 *					  image in the file "output.ppm"
 *
 *	  ppm_test 1 0 1 0      	- would read an image from the file   
 * 					  "input.ppm" and print to screen

Note 1:	Please see the header of "ppm_test.c" for explanation of command
	line arguments.

Note 2: Files "ppm.h" and "ppm.c" may be used by any application needing
	to read and write PPM files.  These files must be used together as
	"ppm.c" depends upon the file "ppm.h".  Please read the source
	code to determine limitations on how they may be used.
