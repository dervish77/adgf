REVISION history for MOS 
------------------------

0.80  05/19/2025  attempt to complete port to C64 platform
                  also numerous cleanup items for unused vars, etc

0.76  09/21/2012  fixed coverage build problem when switching between different PORTs
				  which now allows coverage to work on cygwin
				  
0.75  02/23/2011  fixed coverage analysis via "gcov" in build system
                  enhanced profiling via "gprof" in build system

0.74  02/17/2011  implemented a simulation of Terminal device for linux port
                  modified "mosapp" to use Terminal device
                  added hwCheckTaskTimer function and modified sequence list to use it

0.73  02/15/2011  added port for "c64" using the cc65 compiler

0.72  02/14/2011  moved common source code into "src/ports/common"
                  modified make system to build libmos.a via common and <port>
                  removed "clone" make target

0.71  02/13/2011  use PORT make variable to pick between which toolchain to use
                  cleaned up mosapp and mosunit source code

0.70  04/29/2010  removed all use of malloc, now use static buffers for task memory,
                  and now use static allocation for context structure
                  reduced max size of task memory to 256 bytes

0.62  04/23/2010  added a TODO file to track what still needs doing

0.61  04/07/2010  some general cleanup in code and comments
                  reset versioning scheme to allow for more versions before 1.0

0.6   04/05/2010  renamed unit test as 'mosunit' and test app as 'mosapp'
                  sped up simulated OS time tick
                  added testing of platform functions to 'mosunit'
                  adjusted which files are included for coverage, now it's at 97%

0.53  04/02/2010  improved code coverage results to 82%

0.52  04/01/2010  modified testapp to show no debug text, and altered command line args

0.51  03/31/2010  fixed a bug in the message queue code
                  improved some error detection

0.5   02/09/2010  added debug print facility to use instead of directly using printf,
                  this needs to be ported to each platform

0.41  09/30/2009  added support for setting and retrieving error codes
                  added support for checking valid, suspend, block task states
                  added unit test coverage report analysis (see coverage.sh)

0.4   09/23/2009  renamed all MOS functions to have "mos" as a prefix

0.32  03/25/2009  added SendBroadcast() function
                  added platform.c,h files and GetPlatform() function

0.31  03/24/2009  cleaned up formatting
                  added verbose output control
                  fixed major potential bug - now check return code of FindTaskIndex()

0.3   03/20/2009  added idle task to be created by default (see InitTasking())
                  added support for creating ports of MOS to other platforms (see "src" tree)

0.2   11/08/2007  transformed into MOS (from mainloop)

0.1   10/21/2003  modified for compile by Cygwin

0.0   10/20/2003  Originated
