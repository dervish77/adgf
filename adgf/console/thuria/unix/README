Welcome to Dungeons Of Thuria - version 1.1 
__________________________________________________________________________


1.0 Introduction

   This is a game of interactive fiction in the spirit of those wonderful
games from Infocom.  This game began life as a tribute to the games like
Zork(tm) and others back when the author's only computer was a lowly
Commodore 64.  It was originally written in Basic, and somewhat limited
due to the 64's small memory size.


2.0 The Story of Dungeons of Thuria

   The story of "Thuria" is should be familiar to those who spent countless
hours painstakingly drawing maps for Adventure or Zork in the wee hours
of the morning when they should have been studying or sleeping.  

   You are deposited in a mysterious land with only a single clue as to 
how to get home.  You find a ragged note which describes how to find a portal
which will take you back to your own world.  Of course, the way home is 
riddled with puzzles and deadly traps.


3.0 Playing the Game

   The section below called "Commands:" describes most the available 
commands.  There are several undocumented commands which will only work
with specific objects.  The current command parser cannot cope with 
a natural language style of commands.  Instead, nearly all commands 
are either one or two words.  Single word commands are usually movement
commands (i.e. "n" meaning go north) or implied object commands (i.e. "on"
meaning turn lamp on).  Two words commands are used to do something with
an object (i.e. "take nail" or "wave wand").  There are also commands for 
saving and loading your current game, listing the objects you are carrying, 
and toggling room description modes. 


4.0 Special Note to Code Hackers

   The intent was to develop this game using something of a generic game
engine and command parser, so that other games could be created just
by editing the game data files:

	map.c, room.c, object.c, special.c, magic.c, rank.c, verb.c

There is some support for special effects type objects like magic words, 
spells, and magical objects.  Please refer to the header of each game 
data file for more information on these effects.  Warning, altering these 
effects will require hacking the game engine source code (i.e. cmds.c).  
Also note that only the source to the Unix version is provided.


Hope you enjoy the game!
