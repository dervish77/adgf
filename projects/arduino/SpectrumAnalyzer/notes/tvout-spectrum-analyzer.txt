Arduino Spectrum Analyzer with Video Out - Schematic

Components:
(1)  2n3904 NPN Transistor [Q1]
(3)  1k Ohm Resistor [R2,R4,R5]
(1)  330 Ohm Resistor [R6]
(1)  10k Ohm Resistor [R1]
(1) 100k Ohm Resistor [R3]
(1) Electrolytic Capacitor, 3.3MF [C1]
(1) Electret Microphone [MIC1]

If gain is insufficient, replace Q1 (2n3904 transistor) with 
higher gain transistor or darlington pair.

Video out is NTSC/PAL Composite, if necessary a coupling 
capacitor and diode can be added.
